**Anarchy and Inference**

- Anarchy $\implies$ powerful governments can impose policies on others by force
- Bargaining critique: policies reflect shadow of power
  + @Brito1985, @Fearon1995, @Art1996
- **Question:** Do observed policies reflect **preferences** of the governments that adopted them or **constraints of anarchy?**

## Trade Policy and Gunboat Diplomacy {id="gunboats"}

**What Do Governments Want?**

- **Heterogeneity** in desired protectionism
  + @Grossman1994, @Gawande2009
- Mercantilism induces **conflicts of interest** between governments
  + Gunboat diplomacy: powerful impose openness abroad [@Findlay2007]

. . . 

**Does It Matter?**

- Tariffs small, aggregate policy-induced trade frictions large
  + ~order of magnitude larger than tariffs [@Cooley2019b] (<a href="#/barriers">barriers</a>)
- Welfare effects of trade frictions
  + @Autor2013, @Costinot2015, @Goldberg2016

## Anarchy and Inference: Approach {id="approach"}

**Ideal Experiment**

- Exogenously manipulate governments' military capacity
- Attribute changes in trade policy to latent effect of military coercion

. . . 

**A Coercive International Political Economy**

$$
\left\{ \bm{\theta}, \bm{M} \right\} \rightarrow \bm{\tau}
$$

- $\bm{\theta}$ -- structural parameters (preferences and power projection)
- $\bm{M}$ -- governments' military endowment (expenditure)
- $\bm{\tau}$ -- governments' trade policies

. . . 

**Estimation:** $\left\{ \bm{\tau}, \bm{M} \right\} \rightarrow \bm{\theta}$

. . . 

**Counterfactuals:** $\left\{ \bm{\theta}^\prime, \bm{M}^\prime \right\} \rightarrow \bm{\tau}^\prime$

- Shadow of power
  + Effect of changing military endowments on trade policy
- Liberal/commercial peace
  + Effect of changing preferences for openness on military strategies
