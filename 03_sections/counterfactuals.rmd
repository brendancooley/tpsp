I quantify the effects of military coercion on the international economy by calculating equilibrium policies in a world without militaries. I then compare these to policies consistent with $\tilde{\bm{\theta}}_m$ and observed military strengths. Formally, let $\tilde{\bm{\tau}}^\star(\tilde{\bm{\theta}}_m, \bm{M}$ be equilibrium policies at observed strengths, holding affinity shocks at zero, $\xi_{ij} = 0$ for all $i$, $j$.^[note on why this is the right comparison]
