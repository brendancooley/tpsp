The economy is a variant of that of @Eaton2002. I present the model here for clarity, but refer interested readers to their paper and @Alvarez2007 for derivations and proofs of the existence of a general equilibrium of this economy.

### Consumption

Within each country resides a representative consumer which values tradable goods and nontradable services which are aggregated in Cobb-Douglas utility function, $U_i$.

Consumer utility is Cobb-Douglas in a tradable goods aggregate $Q_i$ and non-tradable services
\begin{equation} \label{eq:CD}
U_i = Q_i^{\nu_i} S_i^{1 - \nu_i}
\end{equation}
$\nu_i$ determines the consumer's relative preference for tradables versus services. Total consumer expenditure is $\tilde{E}_i = E_i^q + E_i^s$ where the Cobb-Douglas preference structure imply $E_i^q = \nu_i \tilde{E}_i$ and $E_i^s = (1 - \nu_i) \tilde{E}_i$.

There is a continuum of tradable varieties indexed $\omega \in [0,1]$ aggregated into $Q_i$ through a constant elasticity of substitution function
\begin{equation} \label{eq:CES}
Q_i = \left( \int_{[0,1]} q_i(\omega)^{\frac{\sigma - 1}{\sigma}} d \omega  \right)^{\frac{\sigma}{\sigma - 1}}
\end{equation}
with $\sigma > 0$. With $E_i^q$ fixed by the upper-level preference structure, consumers maximize $Q_i$ subject to their tradable budget constraint
$$
\int_{[0,1]} p_i(\omega) q_i(\omega) d \omega \leq E_i^q
$$
where $p_i(\omega)$ is the price of variety $\omega$ in country $i$. Let $Q_i^\star$ denote a solution to this problem. The tradable price index $P_i^q$ satisfies $P_i^q Q_i^\star = E_i^q$ with 
$$
P_i^q = \left( \int_{[0,1]} p_i(\omega)^{1 - \sigma} \right)^{\frac{1}{1 - \sigma}}
$$

### Production

Consumers are endowed with labor $L_i$ and earn wage $w_i$ for supplying labor to producers. Services are produced competitively at cost
$$
k_i^s = \frac{w_i}{z_i^s}
$$
where $z_i^s$ is country $i$'s productivity in services. All countries can produce each tradable variety $\omega$. Production requires labor and a tradable goods bundle of intermediate inputs ($Q_i$).  Producing a unit of variety $\omega$ costs
$$
k_i(\omega) = \frac{1}{z_i(\omega)} w_i^{1 - \beta} \left( P_i^q \right)^\beta
$$
with $\beta \in [0,1]$ controlling the share of labor required in production. Total expenditure on intermediates in country $i$ is $E_i^x$. $z_i(\omega)$ controls $i$'s productivity in producing variety $\omega$. $z_i(\omega)$ is a Fréchet-distributed random variable. $F_i(z)$ is the probability $i$'s productivity in producing a tradable variety is less than or equal to $z$. With $F \sim$ Fréchet,
$$
F(z) = \exp \left\{ - T_i z^{-\theta} \right\}
$$
where $T_i$ is a country-specific productivity shifter and $\theta > 1$ is a global parameter that controls the variance of productivity draws around the world. When $\theta$ is large, productivity is less stochastic.

### Trade Frictions

Let $p_{ij}(\omega)$ denote the price in $i$ of a variety $\omega$ produced in $j$. With competitive markets in production, local prices are equal to local costs of production,
$$
p_{ii}(\omega) = k_i(\omega)
$$
When shipped from $i$ to $j$, a variety incurs iceberg freight costs $\delta_{ji}$ and policy costs $\tau_{ji}$, meaning
$$
p_{ji}(\omega) = \tau_{ji} \delta_{ji} p_{ii}(\omega)
$$

Producers and consumers alike search around the world for the cheapest variety $\omega$, inclusive of shipping and policy costs. Equilibrium local prices therefore satisfy
$$
p_i^\star(\omega) = \min_{j \in \left\{ 1,...,N \right\}} \left\{ p_{ij} \right\}
$$
The set of varieties $i$ imports from $j$ is 
$$
\Omega_{ij}^\star = \left\{ \omega \in [0,1] \left. \right\vert p_{ij}(\omega) \leq \min_{k \neq j} \left\{ p_{ik} \right\} \right\}
$$

Total expenditure in country $i$ on goods from $j$ (inclusive of freight costs and policy costs) is $X_{ij}$. At the border, the cost, insurance, and freight (c.i.f.) value of these goods is $X_{ij}^{\text{cif}} = \tau_{ij}^{-1} X_{ij}$. Before shipment, their free on board (f.o.b.) value is $X_{ij}^{\text{fob}} = \left( \delta_{ij} \tau_{ij} \right)^{-1} X_{ij}$

### Tariff Revenue (Policy Rents)

Governments collect the difference between each variety's final value and its c.i.f. value. Total rents for government $i$ are
\begin{equation} \label{eq:revenue}
r_i = \sum_j (\tau_{ij} - 1) X_{ij}^{\text{cif}}
\end{equation}
This revenue is returned to the consumer, but is valued by the government independent of its effect on the consumer's budget.^[This formulation requires the "representative consumer" to encompass individuals that have access to rents and those that do not. It avoids "burning" these rents, as would be implied by a model in which the government valued rents but the consumer did not have access to them.]

### Equilibrium

In equilibrium, national accounts balance and international goods markets clear. Total consumer expenditure is equal to the sum of labor income, tariff revenue, and the value of trade deficits $D_i$
$$
\tilde{E}_i = w_i L_i + r_i + D_i
$$
Labor income is equal to the labor share of all sales of tradables globally and local services sales
\begin{equation} \label{eq:income}
w_i L_i = \sum_j (1 - \beta) X_{ji}^{\text{cif}} + X_i^s
\end{equation}
where
$$
X_i^s = E_i^s = (1 - \nu_i) (w_i L_i + r_i)
$$
The remainder of consumer expenditure is spent on tradables
$$
E_i^q = \nu_i (w_i L_i + r_i) + D_i
$$
A $\beta$-fraction of producer income is spent on intermediates
$$
E_i^x = \sum_j \beta X_{ji}^{\text{cif}}
$$
and total tradable expenditure is
\begin{equation} \label{eq:tExp}
E_i = E_i^q + E_i^x
\end{equation}

The share of $i$'s tradable expenditure spent on goods from $j$ is 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:shares}
x_{ij}(\bm{w}) = \frac{1}{E_i} \int_{\Omega_{ij}^\star} p_{ij}(\omega) q_i^\star \left( p_{ij} (\omega) \right) d \omega = \frac{ T_j \left( \tau_{ij} \delta_{ij} w_j^{1 - \beta} P_j^{\beta} \right)^{-\theta} }{ \frac{1}{C} \left( P_i^q(\bm{w}) \right)^{-\theta}}
\end{equation}
$q_i^\star \left( p_{ij} (\omega) \right)$ is equilibrium consumption of variety $\omega$ from both consumers and producers. $C$ is a constant function of exogenous parameters. The tradable price index is
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Pindex}
P_i^q(\bm{w}) = C \left( \sum_j T_j \left( d_{ij} w_j^{1 - \beta} P_j^{\beta} \right)^{- \theta} \right)^{-\frac{1}{\theta}}
\end{equation}

Finally, I normalize wages to be consistent with world gdp in the data. Denoting world gdp with $Y$, I enforce
\begin{equation} \label{eq:normalization}
Y = \sum_i w_i L_i
\end{equation}

The equilibrium of the economy depends on policy choices $\bm{\tau}$, trade deficits $\bm{D}$, and a vector of structural parameters and constants $\bm{\theta}_h = \left\{ L_i, T_i, \bm{\delta}, \sigma, \theta, \beta, \nu_i, \right\}_{i \in \left\{ 1, ..., N \right\}}$. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
Deeq <- paste0(LETTERS[a], Dtick)
Dtick <- Dtick + 1

DeeqText <- knit_child("../results/Deeq.md")
```

**Definition `r Deeq`:** `r DeeqText`

@Alvarez2007 demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of such an equilibrium, subject to some restrictions on the values of structural parameters and the magnitude of trade costs. 

### Welfare

With the equilibrium mapping in hand, I can connect trade policies to government welfare given in Equation \ref{eq:G}. Consumer indirect utility is
\begin{equation} \label{eq:V}
V_i(\bm{w}) = \frac{\tilde{E}_i(\bm{w})}{P_i(\bm{w})}
\end{equation}
where $P_i$ is the aggregate price index in country $i$ and can be written
$$
P_i(\bm{w}) = \left( \frac{P_i^q(\bm{w})}{\nu_i} \right)^{\nu_i} \left( \frac{P_i^s(\bm{w})}{1 - \nu_i} \right)^{1 - \nu_i}
$$
$P_i^q$ is given in equation \ref{eq:Pindex} and $P_i^s = \frac{w_i}{A_i}$. Substituting $\bm{w}$ with its equilibrium value $h(\bm{\tau}, \bm{D}; \bm{\theta}_h)$ returns consumer indirect utility as a function of trade policies. Equilibrium trade flows can be computed as
$$
X_{ij}^{\text{cif}}(\bm{w}) = \tau_{ij}^{-1} x_{ij}(\bm{w}) E_i(\bm{w})
$$
Substituting these into the revenue equation (\ref{eq:revenue}) gives the revenue component of the government's objective function.

### Equilibrium in Changes

In "hats," the equilibrium conditions corresponding to \ref{eq:revenue}, \ref{eq:income}, \ref{eq:tExp}, \ref{eq:shares}, \ref{eq:Pindex}, and \ref{eq:normalization} are
\begin{equation} \label{eq:revenueHat}
\hat{r}_i = \frac{1}{r_i} \left( E_i \hat{E}_i(\hat{\bm{w}}) - \sum_j X_{ij}^{\text{cif}} \hat{X}_{ij}^{\text{cif}}(\hat{\bm{w}}) \right)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:incomeHat}
\hat{w}_i = \frac{1}{\nu_i w_i L_i} \left( \sum_j \left( (1 - \beta) X_{ji}^{\text{cif}} \hat{X}_{ji}^{\text{cif}}(\hat{\bm{w}}) \right) + (1 - \nu_i) r_i \hat{r}_i(\hat{\bm{w}}) \right)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:tExpHat}
\hat{E}_i(\hat{\bm{w}}) = \frac{1}{E_i} \left( E_i^q \hat{E}_i^q(\hat{\bm{w}}) + E_i^x \hat{E}_i^x(\hat{\bm{w}}) \right)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:sharesHat}
\hat{x}_{ij}(\hat{\bm{w}}) = \left( \hat{\tau}_{ij} \hat{w}_j^{1 - \beta} \hat{P}_j(\hat{\bm{w}})^\beta \right)^{-\theta} \hat{P}_i(\hat{\bm{w}})^{\theta}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:PindexHat}
\hat{P}_i(\hat{\bm{w}}) = \left( \sum_j x_{ij} \left( \hat{\tau}_{ij} \hat{w}_j^{1 - \beta} \hat{P}_j(\hat{\bm{w}})^\beta \right)^{-\theta} \right)^{-\frac{1}{\theta}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:normalizationHat}
1 = \sum_i y_i \hat{w}_i
\end{equation}
where
$$
y_i = \frac{w_i L_i}{\sum_j w_j L_j}
$$

This transformation reduces the vector of parameters to be calibrated to $\bm{\theta}_h = \left\{\theta, \beta, \nu_i, \right\}_{i \in \left\{ 1, ..., N \right\}}$.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
DeeqHat <- paste0(LETTERS[Appdx_tick], Dtick)
Dtick <- Dtick + 1

DeeqHatText <- knit_child("../results/DeeqHat.md")
```

**Definition `r DeeqHat`:** `r DeeqHatText`

### Welfare in Changes

Now changes in consumer welfare can be calculated for any set of trade policy changes $\hat{\bm{\tau}}$. Manipulating \ref{eq:V}, changes in consumer indirect utility are
\begin{equation} \label{eq:VHat}
\hat{V}_i(\bm{w}) = \frac{\hat{\tilde{E}}_i(\hat{\bm{w}})}{\hat{P}_i(\hat{\bm{w}})}
\end{equation}
where
$$
\hat{P}_i(\hat{\bm{w}}) = \hat{P}_i^q(\hat{\bm{w}})^{\nu_i} \hat{P}_i^s(\hat{\bm{w}})^{\nu_i - 1}
$$
and $\hat{P}_i^q(\hat{\bm{w}})$ is given by equation \ref{eq:PindexHat} and $\hat{P}_i^s(\hat{\bm{w}}) = \hat{w}_i$. Changes in policy rents are given by equation \ref{eq:revenueHat}.
