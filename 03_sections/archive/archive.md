$\gamma$ is a structural parameter that governs the returns to military strength. When $\gamma = 1$, $\chi_{ij}(\bm{a}, \bm{m})$ is a standard additive contest function, where strengths are discounted by $\rho_{ij}(\bm{W}; \bm{\alpha})$. When $\gamma = 0$, military strength does not influence contest outcomes and contests are a toss-up, adjusted by $\rho_{ij}(\bm{W}; \bm{\alpha})$ [@Jia2013].
