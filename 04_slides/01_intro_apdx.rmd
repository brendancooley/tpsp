## Bargaining, Trade, and War

**Institutionalized Bargaining**

- Models of GATT/WTO: reciprocity and nondiscriminination

- Institutions and incentive compatibility: war as an outside option [@Powell1994]

**Trade as Means**

- Governments pursue "political" ends (e.g. security), trade used as coercive instrument
	+ @Hirschman1945, @Gowa1993, @Martin2012, @Seitz2015
- Security and power are themselves means to achieve other ends

**Power and Exchange**

- Prices and power in the marketplace
