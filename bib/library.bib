@article{Markowitz2020,
abstract = {Scholars systematically mismeasure power resources and military burdens by using gross domestic product (GDP) as a proxy for the income states can devote to arming. The core problem is that GDP confounds two conceptually distinct forms of income into one additive indicator. Subsistence income represents resources needed to provide the "bread" necessary to cover the basic subsistence needs of the population. Surplus income represents the remaining resources that could be allocated to "guns" or "butter." Our new measure of surplus domestic product (SDP) corrects for this measurement error by decomposing subsistence income and surplus income from total GDP. Validation exercises demonstrate that SDP outperforms GDP at measuring the distribution of power resources. Though theoretically we expect states' decisions to arm are influenced by the distribution of power; empirical models using GDP find mixed support for this expectation. Strikingly, using SDP reveals strong support for this proposition.},

@article{Beckley2010,
abstract = {What makes some states more militarily powerful than others? A growing body of research suggests that certain 'non-material' factors significantly affect a country's ability to translate resources into fighting power. In particular, recent studies claim that democracy, Western culture, high levels of human capital, and amicable civil-military relations enhance military effectiveness. If these studies are correct, then military power is not solely or even primarily determined by material resources, and a large chunk of international relations scholarship has been based on a flawed metric. The major finding of this article, however, suggests that this is not the case. In hundreds of battles between 1898 and 1987, the more economically developed side consistently outfought the poorer side on a soldier-for-soldier basis. This is not surprising. What is surprising is that many of the non-material factors posited to affect military capability seem to be irrelevant: when economic development is taken into account, culture and human capital become insignificant and democracy actually seems to degrade warfighting capability. In short, the conventional military dominance of Western democracies stems from superior economic development, not societal pathologies or political institutions. Therefore, a conception of military power that takes into account both the quantity of a state's resources and its level of economic development provides a sound basis for defense planning and international relations scholarship.},

abstract = {and Keywords The next frontier for the study of trade and war will be the establishment of common microfoundations linking theories of trade to theories of conflict. Too much of the existing economic interdependence literature consists of empirical findings intended to resolve pragmatic debates; but since the evidence is inconclusive, and theories are imprecise, less has been learned than many would like. The literature would benefit from more rigorously defining the relationship between trade and the bargaining model of war. This chapter identifies three sets of causal mechanisms-constrain, inform, and transform-that appear to be likely candidates as drivers of the key findings in the literature. To operationalize and test these mechanisms, greater attention must be paid to the domestic politics of trade and foreign policy. By adopting a microfoundations approach, focusing on agency rather than outcomes, future research can unify disparate literatures and contradictory findings to gain new insights into the nature of trade and war.},

@article{Kono2008,
abstract = {Scholars continue to debate the relationship between democracy and free trade. This paper contributes to this debate by showing that the effects of democracy on trade policy vary across trading partners. Because democratization shifts political power from wealthier individuals to poorer ones, it creates political pressures for trade liberalization with wealthier partners but for increased protection against poorer ones. I test and find support for this hypothesis using dyadic trade flows from 1950 to 2000 and dyadic trade barriers in the 1990s. My results show that democratization leads to trade discrimination against poor countries, primarily via nontariff barriers. This result explains many features of the contemporary global trading system and also highlights the need to combat discrimination in international trade.},

Allowing intergovernmental grants to be designed optimally, we ask whether project authority should rest with the region or with the central government. Centralization is shown to dominate when governments are benevolent. With regionally biased governments, both centralization and decentralization yield inefficiencies and the second-best institution depends on parameter values if political bargaining is prohibited. When bargaining is feasible, however, the first best can often be achieved under decentralization, but not under centralization. At the root of this dichotomy is the alignment of decision making over essential inputs and project size under decentralized governance, and their misalignment under centralization.},

They go on to describe a method that they say I should have used, which is not of interest because the accusation that is supposed to motivate this discussion is inaccurate. The main claim?that my work on suicide terrorism on the dependent variable?is samples simply wrong. Indeed, the authors paid no attention to the large portions of my recent book that explain what we know about that make resort to suicide terrorist campaigns more factors or less likely, and how we know it. Hence, this letter is mainly devoted to updating Ashworth, Clinton, Meirowitz, and Ramsay on my work.

abstract = {Do countries with lower policy-induced barriers to international trade grow faster, once other relevant country characteristics are controlled for? There exists a large empirical literature providing an affirmative answer to this question. We argue that methodological problems with the empirical strategies employed in this literature leave the results open to diverse interpretations. In many cases, the indicators of openness used by researchers are poor measures of trade barriers or are highly correlated with other sources of bad economic performance. In other cases, the methods used to ascertain the link between trade policy and growth have serious shortcomings. Papers that we review include those by Dollar (1992), Ben-David (1993), Sachs and Warner (1995), Edwards (1998), and Frankel and Romer (1999). We find little evidence that open trade policies-in the sense of lower tariff and nontariff barriers to trade-are significantly associated with economic growth.},

abstract = {This paper considers the costs of reducing consumption of a good by making its production illegal and punishing apprehended illegal pro-ducers. We use illegal drugs as a prominent example. We show that the more inelastic either demand for or supply of a good is, the greater the increase in social cost from further reducing its production by greater enforcement efforts. So optimal public expenditures on ap-prehension and conviction of illegal suppliers depend not only on the difference between the social and private values from consumption but also on these elasticities. When demand and supply are not too elastic, it does not pay to enforce any prohibition unless the social value is negative. We also show that a monetary tax could cause a greater reduction in output and increase in price than optimal en-forcement against the same good would if it were illegal, even though some producers may go underground to avoid a monetary tax. When enforcement is costly, excise taxes and quantity restrictions are not equivalent.},

We then use it to make predictions about the quality of a country's public officials and to understand the role of institutions granting politicians with immunity from legal prosecution. The use of punishment lowers the returns from public office and reduces the incentives of high-ability citizens to enter public life. Cheaper plomo and more resources subject to official discretion are associated with more frequent corruption and less able politicians. This predicts that violence in a country will typically go together with corruption and worse politicians. Moreover, the possibility of punishment changes the nature of the influence game, so that even cheaper plata can lower the ability of public officials. Protecting officials from accusations of corruption (immunity) will decrease the frequency of corruption if the judiciary is weak and may increase the quality of politicians. These predictions cannot emerge from a traditional model where only bribes are used.},

How does the United States build and sustain legitimacy for itself in subordi nate countries? In this postcolonial age, the dominant state must rule indi rectly through client regimes. How does the United States ensure legitimacy for such collaborationist regimes? Most important, how does the United States sustain this "double game" of legitimating both its rule and that of its clients, given norms of the sovereign equality of states and, increasingly},

We show how the structure of coalition externalities shapes the choice between sequential and multilateral bargaining, and we identify circumstances in which the grand coalition is the equilibrium outcome, leading to worldwide free trade. A model of international trade is then used to illustrate equilibrium outcomes and how they depend on the structure of trade and protection. Global free trade is not achieved when the political-economy motive for protection is sufficiently large. Furthermore, the model generates both " building bloc " and " stumbling bloc " effects of preferential trade agreements. In particular, we describe an equilibrium in which global free trade is attained only when preferential trade agreements are permitted to form (a building bloc effect), and an equilibrium in which global free trade is attained only when preferential trade agreements are forbidden (a stumbling bloc effect). The analysis identifies conditions under which each of these outcomes emerges.},

The only way distinct regimes can behave differently in similar circumstances is if they have different tastes for settlements. Moreover, dyadic negotiation is dependent on the regime types of both participants. Here we offer a dyadic theory of conflict where states bargain over a good with different attributes: a public good element and an element of private goods like rents. We show that dyad type has important effects on the potential for conflict.

Two schools of analysis exploring the impact of the international system upon domestic politics (regime types, institutions, coalitions, policies) may be distinguished: those which stress the international economy, and those which stress political-military rivalry, or war. Among the former are such arguments as: late industrialization (associated with Gershenkron); dependencia or core-periphery arguments (Wallerstein); liberal development model (much American writing in the 50s and 60s); transnational relation-modernization (Nye, Keohane, Morse); neo-mercantilists (Gilpin); state-centered Marxists (Schurmann). Arguments stressing the role of war include those which focus on the organizational requirements of providing security (Hintze, Anderson), the special nature of foreign relations (classical political theory), territorial compensation (diplomatic history), and strains of foreign involvement (analysis of revolutions). These arguments provide the basis for criticism of much of the literature which uses domestic structure as an explanation of foreign policy, in particular those which (such as the strong-state weak-state distinction) tend, by excessive focus on forms, to obscure the connection between structures and interests, and the role of politics. These arguments also permit criticism of the notion of a recent fundamental discontinuity in the nature of international relations.},

We construct a theory of persistent civil conflicts, where persistence is driven by the endogeno dynamics of inter-ethnic trust and trade. In times of peace, agents belonging to two groups are rando matched to trade bilaterally. Trade hinges on trust and cooperation. The onset of conflict signals that aggressor has a low propensity to cooperate, harming future trust and trade. Agents observe the history o conflicts and update their beliefs over time. The theory predicts that civil wars are persistent. Moreo even accidental conflicts that do not reflect economic fundamentals erode trust, and can plunge a soc into a vicious cycle of recurrent conflicts (a war trap). The incidence of conflict can be reduced by pol abating cultural barriers, fostering inter-ethnic trade and human capital, and shifting beliefs.

For instance, when the size of the police force increases, changes in the perceived likelihood that a crime will be solved may lead a higher fraction of victimizations to be reported to the police. In this paper, three data sets are employed to measure the magnitude of this reporting bias. While each of these analyses is subject to individual criticisms, all of the approaches yield similar estimates. Reporting bias appears to be present but relatively small in magnitude: each additional officer is associated with an increase of roughly five Index crimes that previously would have gone unreported. Taking reporting bias into account makes the hiring of additional police substantially more attractive from a cost-benefit perspective but cannot explain the frequent inability of past studies to uncover a systematic negative relationship between the size of the police force and crime rates.},

abstract = {The limitations of equilibrium theory and of the stability analyses which justify it have led to considerable work on the development of a disequilibrium economic3.r Of the criticisms of stability theory, there are three which have motivated the approach taken in this paper. First, the fundamental question seemingly underlying most stability analyses seems inappropriate. Most papers seem to explore the question of developing an adjustment process which will converge to competitive equilibrium. A more appealing approach is the development of adjustment processes which are designed to reflect some realistic process and then consideration of the long-run position of the market if the process is stable. Second, the economic agents in a disequilibrium process should be aware, at least in part, of the disequilibrium in the economy, and adjust their behavior in response to the altered opportunities which are present. Third, in most markets, all the agents are in the market for their own gain and prices get set by a demander or supplier rather than a nonparticipating auctioneer. There are many models one might want to construct to reflect price adjustments in differently organized markets. In selecting the particular model presented here great weight has been given to mathematical tractability rather than trying to reflect some specific market (although many aspects are patterned after a retail consumer durable market). The purpose has been to develop a very simple model to permit straightforward analysis while hopefully having a framework which will lend itself to generalization. It is assumed that there are many identical firms and many consumers. Each period each firm sets a price and each consumer visits one firm. The consumer either purchases, according to an under-lying demand curve, or concludes that the price is too high and leaves 1 See, e.g., E. S. Phelps et al., " Microeconomic Foundations of Employment and Inflation Theory, " Norton, New York, 1970, and the references given there. 156 PRICE ADJUSTMENT MODEL 157 the store, to enter another the following period. Firms are assumed to know the demands they fa{\$}e (including the prices that cause people to walk out of the store) and to maximize profits separately each period. Consumers are uncertain about future prices and must compare the cost of searching further with the expected gain from finding a better price. The key dynamic element in the model is the consumer adjustment of cutoff prices for consumers entering the market for the first time. This adjustment is not analyzed in detail.

Arms are useful not only for deterrence or taking territory, but also because they influence the resolution of a set of disputed issues. States can cooperate on the issues by limiting military competition, but only as far as an endogenous "war constraint" allows. Factors determining the tightness of the war constraint imply hypotheses about the international determinants of military effort and thus the costs of anarchy. The strategic logic differs from standard security dilemma arguments, in which the costs of anarchy are associated with conflict between status quo states that are uncertain about others' territorial revisionism. Here, inefficiency arises because arming to deter lowers a state's value for living with the status quo, which creates a security externality and a feedback loop. The model both synthesizes and revises a range of theoretical arguments about the determinants of interstate cooperation and conflict.},

We offer the first systematic analysis of the "blood oil" thesis, while at the same time presenting an alternative conception of the relationship between petroleum and international politics. Precisely because oil wars are likely to disrupt the world economy, producers and major consuming nations have intense incentives to seek to deter such contests. In contrast to the conventional wisdom, widespread recognition of the hazard of oil wars actually serves to enhance the territorial integrity of petroleum exporters. Heightened security in turn creates a moral hazard in which oil states have a freer hand to act aggressively abroad. We find no evidence that petroleum exporters are more likely to be attacked. Instead, oil exporters appear better able to flout global norms of non-aggression, more often using force against non-petroleum exporters.},

This hypothesis of a negative relationship between conflict and trade is tested using a ten-year thirty-country cross section merged from four separate data sources. It is found that ceteris paribus countries with the greatest levels of economic trade engage in the least amounts of hostility. In fact, a doubling of trade on average leads to a 20{\%} diminution of belligerence.

abstract = {How large are the intra-national trade costs that separate consumers in remote locations of developing countries from global markets? What do those barriers imply for the intra-national incidence of the gains from falling international trade barriers? We develop a new methodology for answering these questions and apply it to newly collected CPI micro-data from Ethiopia and Nigeria (as well as to the US). In order to overcome three well-known challenges that arise when using price gaps to estimate trade costs, we: (i) work exclusively with a sample of goods that are identified at the barcode-level (to mitigate bias due to unobserved quality differences over space); (ii) collect novel data on the origin location of each product in our sample (to focus only on the pairs of locations that actually identify trade costs); and (iii) use estimates of cost pass-through to correct for markups that potentially vary over space (to extract trade costs from price variation in an environment with potentially oligopolistic intermediaries). Without these corrections, we find that our estimates of the cost of distance would be biased downwards by a factor of approximately four. Our preferred estimates imply that the effect of log distance on trade costs within Ethiopia or Nigeria is four to five times larger than in the US. We also use our pass-through estimates to calculate the incidence of surplus increases due to falling world prices. We find that intermediaries capture the majority of the surplus, and that their share is even higher in distant locations, suggesting that remote consumers see only a small part of the gains from falling international trade barriers.},

Theories claim that trade prevents war and political relations motivate trade, but less is known about whether smaller shifts in political relations impact economic exchange. Looking at two major economies, we show that negative events have not hurt U.S. or Japanese trade or investment flows. We then examine specific incidents of tensions in U.S.-French and Sino-Japanese relations over the past decade—two case pairs that allow us to compare varying levels of political tension given high existing economic interdependence and different alliance relations. Aggregate economic flows and high salience sectors like wine and autos are unaffected by the deterioration of political relations. In an era of globalization, actors lack incentives to link political and economic relations. We argue that sunk costs in existing trade and investment make governments, firms, and consumers unlikely to change their behavior in response to political disputes.},

This work isolates a causality channel by exploiting the fact that the introduction of the steamship in the shipping indus-try produced an asymmetric change in trade distances among coun-tries. Before this invention, trade routes depended on wind patterns. The steamship reduced shipping costs and time in a disproportionate manner across countries and trade routes. Using this source of vari-ation and novel data on shipping, trade, and development, I find that (i) the adoption of the steamship had a major impact on patterns of trade worldwide; (ii) only a small number of countries, character-ized by more inclusive institutions, benefited from trade integration; and (iii) globalization was the major driver of the economic diver-gence between the rich and the poor portions of the world in the years 1850–1900.

In the rent-seeking literature, each party's success Pi (which can be interpreted either as the probability of victory or as the proportion of the prize won) has usually been taken to be a function of the ratio of the respective resource commitments. Alter-natively, however, Pi may instead be a function of the difference between the parties' commit-ments to the contest. The Contest Success Function (CSF) for the difference form is a logistic curve in which, as is consistent with military experience, increasing returns apply up to an inflection point at equal resource commitments. A crucial flaw of the traditional ratio model is that neither one-sided submission nor two-sided peace between the parties can ever occur as a Cournot equilibrium. In contrast, both of these outcomes are entirely consistent with a model in which success is a func-tion of the difference between the parties' resource commitments.},

abstract = {(1999) argue that it provides the underlying motive for the world trading system, while Paul R. Krugman and Maurice Obstfeld (1997, 226) argue that " the terms-of-trade argument is of little practical importance. " Given that the theoretical debate over optimal tariffs goes back over a century, one might ask, " What evidence is there in favor or against the notion that tariffs vary inversely with foreign export supply elasticities? " The answer is none. 1 The theory that a country with market power in trade might gain from protection has a long history but its main insight can be summarized as follows. 2 A tariff creates consumption and pro-duction distortions, but it also creates a terms-of-trade gain if the foreign supply is inelastic, i.e., if the importer has market power. Thus, in the absence of constraints such as trade agreements, 1 There is some evidence that changes in trade policy affect the prices of the goods that countries import (c.f. Mordechai E. Kreinin 1961; Won Chang and Alan L. Winters 2002; Robert C. Feenstra 1989). This evidence generally attributes the effect to imperfect competition in specific industries. More importantly, these studies do not argue or estimate whether countries changed their trade policies to affect their terms-of-trade, much less if they did so taking the export supply elasticity into account. Since our initial working paper, however, independent research by Bagwell and Staiger (2006) provides evidence for their theory by showing that WTO accession leads to greater tariff reductions in products with higher initial import volumes. 2 Seminal contributions on this issue extend back to Robert Torrens (1833) and include John S. Mill (1844), Francis Y. Edgeworth (1894), Tibor Scitovsky (1942), and Harry G. Johnson (1954). Douglas A. Irwin (1996) carefully dis-cusses the history of thought on optimal tariffs.},

Further, we develop an argument predicting democratic transitions based on the level of territorial threat targeting the state: high levels of threat cause political centralization and inhibit democratization; low levels of threat allow for decentralization and democratization. This approach explains how democratic transitions are linked to international borders and imply geographic clustering. Analyses of the post-World War II period are supportive of our arguments even when controlling for clustering-based predictors.},

@article{Reed2008,
abstract = {Existing research on power and war contends that the distribution of power exerts an independent effect on the chances of armed conflict. However, theories of bargaining indicate that power's influence on war depends on the ex ante distribution of benefits and has a specific functional form. We test that claim, showing that the effect of power on war rests heavily on the distribution of benefits. Our findings strongly suggest bargaining explanations may subsume other arguments about power and war both theoretically and empirically. H ow does the distribution of power affect the probability of conflict? Is it possible to specify a distribution of power that is especially likely to lead to conflict? Or does the effect of the distribution of power depend on contextual factors such as the prevailing distribution of territory or other benefits? Scholars have asked these questions since the emergence of world politics as a subfield of political science, yet to a great extent these questions remain unanswered. The earliest work on the distribution of power and conflict recognized that context mattered. Schol-ars understood the substantial conceptual difficulties with observing a relationship between the balance of power and war, and they attempted to resolve these issues by theorizing about different behavioral ex-pectations for satisfied and dissatisfied states. Yet, this theorizing was rarely explicit and left empirical tests of the balance of power and war with few sharp rationalist hypotheses to be evaluated. There is now reason to believe it is possible to provide answers to these enduring questions. The application of bargain-ing theory to the study of international conflict has provided a new avenue for exploring these questions theoretically (Fearon 1995; Gartzke 1999; Reiter 2003). Yet, little empirical evidence has been brought to bear on the bargaining explanation for war as it relates to the distribution of power. Since bargaining theory provides some sharp rationalist hypotheses about the effect of the distribution of power on conflict, what remains to test these hypotheses is a credible empiri-cal strategy for quantifying the theoretical concepts from bargaining theory, and a research design that is true to the theoretical model. Perhaps the greatest empirical challenge to eval-uating the bargaining model of war is to develop an indicator of the ex ante distribution of benefits in order to measure the context for conflict caused by a particular distribution of power. Scholars have exerted some effort in operationalizing contextual effects in terms of alliance patterns, military buildups, and the correlations among states' United Nations roll-call voting. We believe the next important step in research on power and war is to apply a credible contextual measure of the distribution of benefits to evaluate hypotheses from bargaining theories of war. One important contribution of our paper is that we develop a measure of the distribution of benefits in order to test the principle hypothesis of Powell's (1999) bargaining model of war. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique and United Nations (UN) roll-call data, we build such a measure and test the effect of the distribution of power on conflict while accounting for the context given by the distribution of benefits. The empirical model we report closely mirrors the functional form and con-text of the equilibrium from Powell's bargaining model. Our results are striking in how strongly they confirm the intuition of the bargaining model and fit with the explicit functional form relating capabilities},

abstract = {Norms have never been absent from the study of international politics, but the sweeping "ideational turn" in the 1980s and 1990s brought them back as a central theoretical concern in the field. Much theorizing about norms has focused on how they create social structure, standards of appropriateness, and stability in international politics. Recent empirical research on norms, in contrast, has examined their role in creating political change, but change processes have been less well-theorized. We induce from this research a variety of theoretical arguments and testable hypotheses about the role of norms in political change. We argue that norms evolve in a three-stage "life cycle" of emergence, "norm cascades," and internalization, and that each stage is governed by different motives, mechanisms, and behavioral logics. We also highlight the rational and strategic nature of many social construction processes and argue that theoretical progress will only be made by placing attention on the connections between norms and rationality rather than by opposing the two.},

Results show that the benefits of international trade exceed trade's environmental costs due to CO 2 emissions by two orders of magnitude. While proposed regional carbon taxes on the CO 2 emissions from shipping would increase global welfare and increase the implementing region's GDP, they would also harm poor countries.

To this end, the paper describes a model of trade and the environment, compiles new data on CO 2 emissions from international and intranational shipping, and estimates the model's key parameters via panel data regressions. The model and data are used to examine two types of counterfactuals. The first counterfactual asks: how would welfare change if all international trade ceased? Autarky for all countries is (hopefully) not a realistic policy, but it provides a benchmark for studying real policies. This study finds that international trade increases CO 2 emissions by 5 percent. Several influential papers ask whether international trade is good for the environment (Copeland and Taylor 1994; Antweiler, Copeland, and Taylor 2001; Copeland and Taylor 2003; and Frankel and Rose 2005). I find that the global gains from international trade, equal to {\$}5.5 trillion annually, exceed the costs of international trade due to CO 2 emissions by a factor of 161.

abstract = {To reduce crime, cities focus state resources in high-crime “hot spot” streets. A U.S. literature argues that this approach, especially policing, has large direct effects and beneficial spillovers - a finding consistent with criminal rents being concentrated in a very small number of streets. We need large samples, however, to accurately assess local spillovers. An experiment in Bogot{\'{a}}, Colombia is an order of magnitude larger than previous opportunities to evaluate such policies. The city identified 1,919 hot spots and randomly assigned them to either 8 months of doubled policing, greater municipal services (cleanup and lighting), both interventions, or neither. At this scale, however, spillovers in dense networks can introduce bias and complicate variance estimation through “fuzzy clustering”. We show valid hypothesis testing requires randomization inference. We find that intensive policing or municipal services alone had small direct effects on security in hot spots, but together both interventions reduced crime substantially. Nonetheless, the evidence points to both interventions displacing crime to neighboring streets. On average, aggregate crime appears to have increased in Bogot{\'{a}}, and we can rule out decreases in aggregate crime of more than 1-2{\%}. These results are consistent with a situation where illegal opportunities are not highly concentrated in a city, a large proportion of crime (especially property crime) has a sustained motive, and criminals shift activities to places where they have lower risks of detection.},

Using a standard multicountry trade model, we measure openness by a country's potential welfare gain from moving to a world with frictionless trade. In this model, a country's trade potential depends on only the trade elasticity and two observable statistics: the country's home trade share and its income level. Quantitatively, poor countries have greater potential gains from trade relative to rich countries, while their welfare costs of autarky are similar. This leads us to infer that rich countries are more open to trade. Our trade potential index correlates strongly with estimates of trade costs, while both the welfare cost of autarky and the volume of trade exhibit correlate weakly with trade costs. Thus, our measure of openness is informative about the underlying trade frictions.},

I estimate the elasticity of consumption growth to Chinese retaliatory tariffs to be around minus one. This implies that counties in the upper quartile of the retaliatory-tariff distribution experienced a 3.8 percentage point decline in consumption growth. The fall in consumption corresponds with decline in both tradeable and retail employment. These results suggest that Chinese retaliation is leading to concentrated welfare losses in the US.

We show how the redrawing of the European map at the Congress of Vienna 1815-notably Prussia's control over the Rhineland and Westphalia-affected the incentives for policymakers to cooperate. Our argument comes in three steps. First, we show that the new borders were not endogenous to trade. They were at odds with the strategy of Prussia in 1815, but followed from Britain's intervention at Vienna regarding the Polish-Saxon question. Second, we develop a theoretical framework, where state planners set tariffs on imports and transits to maximize revenue. We show that in a world with transit tariffs a revenue-maximizing state planner faces a trade-off between benefits from cooperation and the cost of loosing geographical advantage. In a third step we calibrate the model combining historical data on tariffs, freight rates, market sizes with GIS data on lowest costs routes under endogenous tariffs. We then run counterfactuals to show how borders affected incentives: if Prussia would have succeeded with her strategy to gain the entire Kingdom of Saxony instead of the western provinces, the Zollverein would not have formed. We conclude that geography can shape institutional change. To put it differently, as a collateral damage to her intervention at Vienna "Britain unified Germany".},

Institutions that are more responsive to narrow-interest groups are expected to succumb to protectionist demands, resulting in higher average tariffs. This literature has largely ignored the role of reciprocal trade agreements and of exporter interests. This joint omission results in a biased view of trade politics. Exporters benefit from expanding market access abroad. With reciprocity, they lobby for domestic tariff cuts in exchange for liberalization abroad, which alters the link between domestic institutions and trade policies. Institutions favoring narrow interests should privilege both protectionist groups and exporters and hence have an indeterminate effect on average tariff levels. Instead, more interest group influence should result in more dispersed tariff rates across products. This article provides empirical evidence for this proposition, helps reconcile existing findings in the literature , and offers a specific example of how international institutions affect domestic politics.},

abstract = {How do states use economic-security linkages in international bargaining? Governments can provide economic benefits as a side payment to reinforce security cooperation and use close security ties as a source of bargaining leverage in economic negotiations. Domestic political pressures, however, may constrain the form of linkage. First, economic side payments are more likely to be chosen in areas that will not harm the key interests of the ruling party. Second, involvement by the legislature pushes governments toward using security ties as bargaining leverage for economic gains. Evidence from negotiations between Britain and Japan during the Anglo-Japanese alliance of 1902 to 1923 supports the constraining role of domestic politics. Economic-security linkages occurred as Britain gave favorable economic treatment to Japan in order to strengthen the alliance. Economic competition between the allies, however, made it difficult for Britain to grant asymmetrical economic benefits. In tariff negotiations where business interests had more influence in the domestic policy process, the alliance was used as leverage to force reciprocity.},

abstract = {This paper blends recent research on hierarchy and democratization to examine the theoretical and empirical costs of treating regime type exogenously in the literature most identified with studying its impact on international politics. It argues that the apparent peace among democratic states that emerges in the aftermath of World War I is not caused by domestic institutional attributes normally associated with democracy. Instead, this peace is an artifact of historically specific great power settlements. These settlements shape subsequent aggregate patterns of military conflict by altering the organizational configuration of the system in three critical ways—by cre-ating new states, by altering hierarchical orders, and by influencing regime type in states. These claims are defended with a series of tests that show first how the statistical rela-tionship between democracy and peace has exhibited substantial variation across great power orders; second, that this statistical relationship breaks down with theoretically motivated research design changes; and third, that great powers foster peace and similar regime types within their hierarchical orders. In short, the relationship between democracy and peace is spurious. The international political order is still built and managed by great powers. The democratic peace literature has long existed in a paradoxical state. Its central em-pirical finding, namely that democracies engage in less military conflict with each other than all other types of regime pairings, has remained remarkably robust in the face of numerous theoretical and empirical challenges. A series of recent papers reaffirming this statistical relationship argue that attempts to overturn this em-pirical association should be greeted with skepticism given the volume of supportive evidence that has accumulated. 1 At the same time, a lingering theoretical uncertainty over the precise mechanisms by which democracy might promote peace preserves some doubt about the strength of any causal relationship. Consequently, the demo-cratic peace remains a stronger descriptive inference than a causal inference. 2},

abstract = {This study argues that a subtle shift in the primary independent variable of the commercial peace literature-from trade to free trade-provides an opportunity to respond to the some of the strongest criticisms of this research program. Free trade, and not just trade, promotes peace by removing an important foundation of domestic privilege-protective barriers to international commerce-that enhances the domestic power of societal groups likely to support war, reduces the capacity of free-trading interests to limit aggression in foreign policy, and simultaneously generates political support for the state often used to build its war machine. A series of statistical tests demonstrates that higher levels of free trade, rather than trade alone, reduce military conflict between states. Moreover, contrary to conventional wisdom, these arguments suggest how the puzzling case of World War I may confirm, rather than contradict, the central claims of commercial liberalism. Thedebateoverwhetherandhowinternationalcommercealterstheforeignpolicyof states, and in particular the decision for war, has gained renewed prominence in the fields of international security and international political economy. Despite substantial empirical support for the proposition that increasing levels of cross-border economic flows-defined either in terms of trade or capital movements-decrease the probability of conflict, scholars have yet to approach a consensus concerning the precise nature of this link. A number of explanations have been proposed. Trade promotes peace through communication and transnational ties that increase understanding among societies and the potential for cooperation. While expanding an international web of commerce through specialization, trade makes war less likely by increasing the costs of severing such economic links. Interdependence makes conflict less likely because of its efficiency over conquest in acquiring resources necessary for growth and prosperity.},

The first, a quasi-behavioral approach, makes nonstandard assumptions about the preferences, beliefs, or decision-making processes of aggregate actors. The second tries to build theories in which the key actors are individuals. Pursuing the former means that the assumptions about actors will be only weakly linked to the empirical findings propelling behavioral research.

Tracking the movement of arrested unlawfully present immigrants along the several steps of the immigration enforcement pipeline, and exploiting a large shift in federal enforcement priorities in mid 2011, we disentangle the three key components of the variation in deportation rates: federal enforcement efforts, local enforcement efforts, and the composition of the pool of arrestees. This decomposition allows us to recover the local (county) level response to changes in federal enforcement intensity. Among urban counties, 80 percent, mostly Democratic but with small shares of Hispanics, exhibit strategic substitutabilities. The inverse relationship between federal and local efforts allowed most counties to reduce opposition to the policy, and was accompanied by an increased alignment of local and federal preferences. The federal level was very effective in directing its enforcement efforts towards counties where it expected local collaboration, but conflict was mostly driven by a change in the types of unlawfully present immigrants it prioritized for removal.},

abstract = {This paper measures the effect of sharing a national state on the degree of trade integration. We call the causal effect of this political integration the economic integration-this is the additional trade integration gained by entities which come together to form a country rather being independent countries. The existence of very large border effects, even within the European Union, is well known, and is a consequence of this aforementioned economic integration achieved within national states. Nevertheless, there are two potential reasons why these border effects could overestimate the gains from sharing a state. First, there could be a substitution of frictions: by integrating within a state, there could be a deterioration of links to the rest of the world. We see that this is not the case. Secondly, there could be an issue of endogenity and selection bias: places which share larger affinities are more likely to both trade with each other and to select into sharing a state. We conclude that this is an important issue and so this endogeneity means that estimates of the average border effect overstate the reductions in trade frictions achieved by sharing a state. To deal with this endogeneity problem we propose an alternative approach. We identify marginal regions (regions which could conceivably be independent countries by themselves) and marginal countries (countries that are the closest trading partner in the data to the country to which that marginal regions belong). We propose that the gap in trade frictions between these marginal regions and marginal countries is a much better estimate to the causal impact of state sharing. Even controlling for selection bias, we find that the gains from economic integration are still substantial: it is about one third of the total gains from trade.},

abstract = {Standards of living between the richest and poorest countries differ by more than a factor of 30. A large literature has evolved that attempts to explain this fact within the context of a standard (closed-economy) neoclassical growth model. The consensus is that physical and human capital accounts for only 50 percent of the variation in income per worker; the rest is productivity differences. Given this finding, a growing literature has attempted to understand how various frictions result in large differences in measured productivity across countries. In this paper, I develop a novel view of the frictions to trade between rich and poor countries by arguing that to reconcile bilateral trade volumes and price data within a standard gravity model, the trade frictions between rich and poor countries must be systematically asymmetric, with poor countries facing higher costs to export relative to rich countries. I then argue that these frictions to trade are quantitatively important to understanding why standards of living and measured total factor productivity between the richest and poorest countries differ by so much. The starting point of my analysis is a multicountry model of trade combining a standard gravity model with elements from a neoclassical growth model. Each country has two sectors: a tradable goods sector and a final goods sector, both with constant returns technologies. Labor, capital, and tradable goods are used as factors of production. In the tradable goods sector there is a continuum of goods. As in Rudiger Dornbusch, Stanley Fischer, and Paul A. Samuelson (1977), production technologies differ across goods on the continuum only in their productivity levels. As in Jonathan Eaton and Samuel Kortum (2002), productivity levels are treated as random variables drawn from a parameterized distribution. Each country's distribution differs in its average productivity level. Trades occur only within intermediate goods, which are purchased from the country with the lowest price that includes "iceberg" costs to trade. The final goods sector produces a nontraded consumption good with a technology common to all countries. Within this framework, I first ask: What trade costs between rich and poor countries are necessary to reconcile bilateral trade volumes and aggregate price data? The building block to},

It determines which states achieve the greatest gains from these institutions by identifying a central reason that states fail to cooperate in international relations: they fear being “held up” by other states for political concessions. Political hold-up problems occur when one state fails to undertake an otherwise productive investment due to the increased ability it would give another state to extract political concessions. Focusing on the World Trade Organization (WTO), I demonstrate that political hold-up problems are pervasive in international relations due to links between economic and political policies, but that international institutions can solve hold-up problems by helping to enforce agreements. I first formalize this argument and then empirically test the implications derived from the model, finding that the WTO increases trade most for politically dissimilar states by reducing states' abilities to hold up their trading partners for foreign policy concessions. I provide evidence of the causal mechanism by showing that WTO membership increases trade in contract-intensive goods and boosts fixed capital investment. I conclude that by solving political hold-up problems, international institutions can normalize relations between politically asymmetric states that differ in terms of capabilities, regime types, and alliances.},

We find that democracies tend to have lower trade barriers than non-democracies but are more likely to protect their agricultural sectors. We also find that pairs of democracies achieve greater tariff reductions in bilateral Free Trade Agreements than dyads with a democracy and a non-democracy because of shallower concessions granted by non-democratic importers to their democratic partners; democratic importers meanwhile still grant concessions to their non-democratic partners.

Because governments in democracies are more responsive to voters, they should implement lower tariffs. We develop an implication of this line of argument. If lower tariffs are a response to consumer interests, lower tariffs should be concentrated on products most relevant to consumers. Using data on consumption shares across product categories, we report evidence that consumer interests do not account for lower tariffs. Governments place higher tariffs on goods with higher consumption shares, and we find no evidence that this relationship attenuates under more democratic institutions. There may be a variety of reasons why more democratic states are engaged in higher levels of international trade. A larger concern for consumer interests, however, is likely not among them.},

The approach provides an attractive alternative to existing methods for estimating general levels of trade restrictions for a wide array of nations over a substantial period of time. Existing indicators are either gravely biased or demand immense amounts of detailed data (or both). Our measure is theoretically grounded, easy to calculate with available data, consistent with the accepted contrasts drawn between notoriously closed and open economies in different periods, and it moves closely in line with well-documented policy reforms made recently in a variety of nations. At the same time the measure differs markedly from the most commonly used indexes of trade policy in a variety of important ways and cases, suggesting, for example, that those indexes dramatically overstate the degree of change in U.S. trade policy over the last three decades and the differences between U.S. and Japanese policy openness. Use of the new measure may thus have an important impact on results in several key fields of research-including studies of the effects of trade openness on growth and income inequality, and analyses of the politics of protectionism. 2},

abstract = {Why do states delegate certain tasks and responsibilities to international organizations rather than acting unilaterally or cooperating directly? Furthermore, to what extent do states continue to control IOs once authority has been delegated? Examining a variety of different institutions including the World Trade Organization, the United Nations and the European Commission, this book explores the different methods that states employ to ensure their interests are being served, and identifies the problems involved with monitoring and managing IOs. The contributors suggest that it is not inherently more difficult to design effective delegation mechanisms at international level than at domestic level and, drawing on principal-agent theory, help explain the variations that exist in the extent to which states are willing to delegate to IOs. They argue that IOs are neither all evil nor all virtuous, but are better understood as bureaucracies that can be controlled to varying degrees by their political masters.},

While existing research highlights member states' power, preference intensity, and the IO's institutional design, this paper introduces an additional source of bargaining power in IOs: Through issue linkage members of an IO leverage privileged positions in other IOs to obtain more favorable bargaining outcomes. Specifically, European Union members are more successful in bargaining over the EU budget while they hold a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). Inside the UNSC EU members can promote security interests of other European countries, and they can use their influence to secure side-payments from the EU budget. The study tests this argument by investigating new EU budget data, and it shows that EU members obtain 1.7 billion Euro in additional net receipts during a two-year UNSC term, on average. Thus, bargaining processes in the EU and the UN are intricately linked.},

abstract = {The number of preferential trade agreements (PTAs) has skyrocketed over the past twenty years. In addition to reducing barriers at the border, modern PTAs remove many behind-the-border barriers by regulating foreign direct investment (FDI), liberalizing services, and protecting intellectual property rights. This paper surveys the literature explaining the formation of PTAs and their consequences. Regarding the formation of PTAs, I document that studies have gradually moved from exploring the macro-foundation of preferential liberalization to focusing on the micro-foundation of PTAs, relying on industry-and firm-level data. Regarding the effect of PTAs, there is robust evidence that PTAs substantively increase trade flows and FDI and are associated with economic reforms in developing countries, though the general welfare effect of preferential liberalization remains largely unexplored. In moving forward, I make some concrete suggestions on avenues toward which to push the research on PTAs. In particular, I argue that scholars interested in PTAs would benefit from engaging in debate about the distributional consequences of trade liberalization, which not only informs much of the current academic and policy research, but also features in political debates taking place in democratic polities.},

We then use the model to quantify the aggregate effects of distortions in the highway network. Altogether, aggregate income is 0.75 percent higher with the optimal highway network compared to the actual highway network. Counterfactual networks with political distortions simply modeled using standard iceberg transportation costs are shown to account for a portion of these welfare losses. Finally, we use light data regressions to show that political distortions to the optimal network are also associated with slower growth.},

What explains the similarities and differences in expropriation between regime types? An analysis of actual expropriation acts in 63 developing countries from 1960 to 1990 shows that democracies are most likely to expropriate foreign investment when leaders face little political constraint and when they reside in countries with frequent leadership turnover. Autocrats are least likely to expropriate foreign assets when they face high political constraints and have stayed in power for a long time. In essence, the chief executive's political incentive and policy-making capacity determine the host government's expropriation decisions. The findings have important implications for the rule of law, property rights protection, investment behaviors, and the prospect of privatization reforms.},

@article{Milanovic2000,
abstract = {The median-voter hypothesis has been central to an extensive literature on consequences of income redistribution. For example, it has been proposed that greater inequality is associated with lower growth, because of the greater redistribution that is sought by the median voter when income distribution is less equal. There have however been no proper tests of the median-voter hypothesis concerning redistribution, because of previous absence of data on factor-income distribution (that is, incomes before taxes and transfers) across households, and thus on the gains by poorer households from redistribution. The study reported in this paper is based on the required data, with 79 observations drawn from household budget surveys from 24 democracies. The results strongly support the conclusion that countries with greater inequality of factor income redistribute more to the poor. This is so even when we control for the share of the elderly in the population and for pension transfers. The evidence that the median-voter hypothesis adequately describes the collective-choice mechanism is however considerably weaker. Although middle-income groups gain more/or lose less through redistribution in countries where initial (factor) income distribution is more unequal, this regularity is all but lost when, by excluding pensions, we look only at explicit redistributive social transfers from which middle classes contemporaneously gain little. This leaves us searching for an alternative explanation: do middle-classes gain from transfers in the long run even if not contemporaneously?; or is the median-voter hypothesis, based on direct democracy, a proper representation of the mechanisms of collective decision making in representative democracy?},

abstract = {Distance between buyers and sellers can create search and contracting problems: how to find out what goods are available in far away places, and ensure they are actually delivered? Traveling to do business in person is one way of dealing with both, transforming a remote transaction into one that is face-to-face. I estimate the magnitude of search and contracting frictions in a developing country context by exploiting the fact that travel is a common, costly, and easily observable strategy for coping with them. I collect transaction-level panel data from Nigerian importers of consumer goods that combines the “what” of trade (e.g. products, quantities) with variables describing “how” trade is conducted (e.g. travel, payment terms). To account for patterns inconsistent with a full information environment, I build and estimate a model that embeds a search problem and a repeated game with moral hazard into a monopolistically competitive trade framework. Welfare from imported consumer goods would be 29{\%} higher in the absence of both frictions. I decompose the total barrier into parts attributable to search and to contracting, and show why the effects will be larger in markets with low consumer spending, high firm entry/exit rates, and frequently changing products. The results suggest that greater attention to market integration policies beyond transportation and tariffs could have large welfare effects, particularly in developing countries. In counterfactual scenarios, I show that regulation of air travel between Nigeria and China would yield gains in Nigeria on the order of {\$}650 million per year through consumer goods trade alone, while existing financial services do little to mitigate frictions because they do not offer a better contract enforcement technology than travel or repeated interaction.},

Awards: Pulitzer prize winner Pulitzer prize winner Chronicles the struggle for wealth and power that has surrounded oil for decades and that continues to fuel global rivalries, shake the world economy, and transform the destiny of men and nations. Now with a new epilogue that speaks directly to the current energy crisis, "The Prize" recounts the panoramic history of the world's most important resource: oil. Daniel Yergin's timeless book chronicles the struggle for wealth and power that has surrounded oil for decades and that continues to fuel global rivalries, shake the world economy, and transform the destiny of men and nations. This updated edition categorically proves the unwavering significance of oil throughout the twentieth century and into the twenty-first by tracing economic and political clashes over precious "black gold." With his far-reaching insight and in-depth research, Yergin is uniquely positioned to address the present battle over energy, which undoubtedly ranks as one of the most vital issues of our time. The canvas of his narrative history is enormous -- from the drilling of the first well in Pennsylvania through two great world wars to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, Operation Desert Storm, and now both the Iraq War and climate change. The definitive work on the subject of oil, "The Prize" is a book of extraordinary breadth, riveting excitement, and great value -- crucial to our understanding of world politics and the economy today -- and tomorrow. -- Back cover.

The Court can declare illegal European Union (EU) laws and national laws that violate the Treaty of Rome in areas traditionally considered to be purely the prerogative of national governments, including social policy, gender equal- ity, industrial relations, and competition policy, and its decisions are respected. Nev- ertheless, there is significant disagreement about the extent of the Court's political autonomy from member states and the extent to which it can decide cases against their interests. Legal and neofunctionalist scholars have asserted that the ECJ has significant autonomy by virtue of the separation of law and politics and the inherent legitimacy of courts as legal actors, and that it can use this autonomy to rule against the interests of member states.2 Such an analysis implies that virtually any court, international or national, can decide against a government's interests because it is a legal body.3 Neorealist analysts have argued that member states have sufficient control over the Court so that it lacks the autonomy to decide against the interests of powerful mem- ber states.4 This implies that the ECJ, as an international court, is particularly depen- dent on national governments and must bend to their interests.},

@article{Chaney2008,
abstract = {By considering a model with identical firms, Paul Krugman (1980) predicts that a higher elas-ticity of substitution between goods magnifies the impact of trade barriers on trade flows. In this paper, I introduce firm heterogeneity in a simple model of international trade. When the distribu-tion of productivity across firms is Pareto, which is close to the observed size distribution of US firms, the predictions of the Krugman model with representative firms are overturned: the impact of trade barriers on trade flows is dampened by the elasticity of substitution, and not magnified. In Krugman (1980), identical countries trade differentiated goods despite the presence of trade barriers because consumers have a preference for variety. If goods are less substitutable, con-sumers are willing to buy foreign varieties even at a higher cost, and trade barriers have little impact on bilateral trade flows. Total exports from country A to country B are given by the fol-lowing expression: GDP A 3 GDP B Exports AB 5 Constant 3 , 1Trade barriers AB 2 s where s is the elasticity of substitution between varieties. A crucial assumption in this model is that all firms are identical, and that the only form of transportation cost is a variable cost. Under these assumptions, every firm exports to every country in the world. Trade barriers have a strong impact on trade flows when the elasticity of substitution between goods is high. Competition is fierce when the elasticity of substitution is high, and any cost disadvantage translates into large losses of market share. In this paper, I add firm heterogeneity in productivity, as well as fixed costs of exporting. These simple amendments introduce a new margin of adjustment: the extensive margin. When transportation costs vary, not only does each exporter change the size of its exports (the intensive margin), but the set of exporters varies as well (the extensive margin). The main finding of this paper is that the elasticity of substitution has opposite effects on each margin. A higher elastic-ity makes the intensive margin more sensitive to changes in trade barriers, whereas it makes the extensive margin less sensitive. The reason is the following. When trade barriers decrease, new and less productive firms enter the export market. When the elasticity of substitution is high, a low productivity is a severe disadvantage. These less productive firms can capture only a small market share. The impact of those new entrants on aggregate trade is small. On the other hand, when the elasticity is low, each firm is sheltered from competition. The new entrants capture a},

At best, violence results in mere redistribution; being destructive, it more often results in a loss of social welfare. When organized, however, violence can be socially productive; it can be employed to defend property rights, thereby strengthening the incentives to engage in productive activity. To explore how violence can be rendered a source of welfare, the authors develop a model of a stateless society in which people's rights to the product of their labor are secure only if they possess coercive capabilities. Using case materials and formal logic, the authors then compare this outcome with that obtained when private agents reward specialists in violence for defending property rights. In doing so, we plumb the role of the state.},

Until recently, however, many large-N studies have paid only scant attention to variation across PTAs in terms of content and design. Our contribution to this literature is a new dataset on the design of trade agreements that is the most comprehensive in terms of both variables coded and agreements covered. We illustrate the dataset's usefulness in re-visiting the questions if and to what extent PTAs impact trade flows. The analysis shows that on average PTAs increase trade flows, but that this effect is largely driven by deep agreements. In addition, we provide evidence that provisions that tackle behind-the-border regulation matter for trade flows. The dataset's contribution is not limited to the PTA literature, however. Broader debates on topics such as institutional design and the legalization of international relations will also benefit from the novel data. A. D{\"{u}}r et al.},

Although the norm seeks to make the world a more peaceful place, it may instead cause it to become more conflict prone. Among sociopolitically weak states—states that lack legitimate and effective governmental institutions—fixed borders can actually increase instability and conflict. Adherence to the norm of fixed borders can lead to the perpetuation and exacerbation of weakness in states that are already weak or that have just gained independence. It does so by depriving states of what was traditionally the most potent incentive to increase efforts of state building: territorial pressures. By creating conditions that are rife for the spillover of civil wars and by supplying opportunities for foreign predation, sociopolitically weak states in a world of fixed borders have become a major source of interstate conflict in much of the ...},

abstract = {Suicide terrorism is rising around the world, but the most common explanations do not help us understand why. Religious fanaticism does not explain why the world leader in suicide terrorism is the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, a group that adheres to a Marxist/Leninist ideology, while existing psychological explanations have been contradicted by the widening range of socio-economic backgrounds of suicide terrorists. To advance our understanding of this growing phenomenon, this study collects the universe of suicide terrorist attacks worldwide from 1980 to 2001, 188 in all. In contrast to the existing explanations, this study shows that suicide terrorism follows a strategic logic, one specifically designed to coerce modern liberal democracies to make significant territorial concessions. Moreover, over the past two decades, suicide terrorism has been rising largely because terrorists have learned that it pays. Suicide terrorists sought to compel American and French military forces to abandon Lebanon in 1983, Israeli forces to leave Lebanon in 1985, Israeli forces to quit the Gaza Strip and the West Bank in 1994 and 1995, the Sri Lankan government to create an independent Tamil state from 1990 on, and the Turkish government to grant autonomy to the Kurds in the late 1990s. In all but the case of Turkey, the terrorist political cause made more gains after the resort to suicide operations than it had before. Thus, Western democracies should pursue policies that teach terrorists that the lesson of the 1980s and 1990s no longer holds, policies which in practice may have more to do with improving homeland security than with offensive military action.

He defines governance as the systems of authoritative norms, rules, institutions, and practices by means of which any collectivity manages its common affairs, while global governance can be considered as an instance of governance in the absence of government. He tells that there is no government at the global level. But there is governance, of variable effectiveness.},

abstract = {We investigate the role of networks of alliances in preventing (multilateral) interstate wars. We first show that, in the absence of international trade, no network of alliances is peaceful and stable. We then show that international trade induces peaceful and stable networks: Trade increases the density of alliances so that countries are less vulnerable to attack and also reduces countries' incentives to attack an ally. We present historical data on wars and trade showing that the dramatic drop in interstate wars since 1950 is paralleled by a densification and stabilization of trading relationships and alliances. Based on the model we also examine some specific relationships, finding that countries with high levels of trade with their allies are less likely to be involved in wars with any other countries (including allies and nonallies), and that an increase in trade between two countries correlates with a lower chance that they will go to war with each other.},

abstract = {The striking growth in the trade share of output is one of the most important developments in the world economy since World War II. Two features of this growth present challenges to the standard trade models. First, the growth is generally thought to have been generated by falling tariff barriers worldwide. But tariff barriers have decreased by only about 11 percentage points since the early 1960s; the standard models cannot explain the growth of trade without assuming coun-terfactually large elasticities of substitution between goods. Second, tariff declines were much larger prior to the mid 1980s than after, and yet, trade growth was smaller in the earlier period than in the later period. The standard models have difficulty generating this non-linear feature. This paper develops a two-country dynamic Ricardian trade model that offers a resolution of these two puzzles. The key idea embedded in this model is vertical specialization, which occurs when countries specialize only in particular stages of a good's production This paper is a revision and extension of Ishii and Yi (1997).

abstract = {A growing number of preferential trade agreements (PTAs) have come to play a significant role in governing state compliance with human rights. When they supply hard standards that tie material benefits of integration to compliance with human rights principles, PTAs are more effective than softer human rights agreements (HRAs) in changing repressive behaviors. PTAs improve members' human rights through coercion, by supplying the instruments and resources to change actors' incentives to promote reforms that would not otherwise be implemented. I develop three hypotheses: (1) state commitment to HRAs and (2) PTAs supplying soft human rights standards (not tied to market benefits) do not systematically produce improvement in human rights behaviors, while (3) state commitment to PTAs supplying hard human rights standards does often produce better practices. I draw on several cases to illustrate the processes of influence and test the argument on the experience of 177 states during the period 1972 to 2002.},

abstract = {Studies of bargaining and war generally focus on two sources of incomplete information: uncertainty over the probability of victory and uncertainty over the costs of fighting. We introduce uncertainty over preferences of a spatial policy and argue for its relevance in crisis bargaining. Under these conditions, standard results from the bargaining model of war break down: peace can be Pareto inefficient and it may be impossible to avoid war. We then extend the model to allow for cheap talk pre-play communication. Whereas incentives to misrepresent normally render cheap talk irrelevant, here communication can cause peace and ensure that agreements are efficient. Moreover, peace can become more likely as (1) the variance in the proposer's belief about its opponent's type increases and (2) the costs of war decrease. Our results indicate that one major purpose of diplomacy is simply to communicate preferences and that such communications can be credible.},

abstract = {Although the possibility of solving crises by the parties trading concessions on different issues is attractive in theory, linkage is rarely done in practice. Offers to link issues could be misinterpreted as signals of weakness, leading to their rejection. The fear of such an opportunistic rejection discourages senders from offering linkage. This paper examines a signaling game of linkage in crisis bargaining. One side has a choice of linked and unlinked offers, whereas the other side could accept or reject either offer, or go to war. Each side could be one of two types, based on their knowledge of the attractiveness of war for the sender and the attractiveness of the added issue for the receiver. Linkage succeeds in the model only under particular conditions. Paradoxically, the possibility that linkage may lead to an attack often promotes its success. Linkage is most likely to succeed when the sender is stronger than the receiver, but not overwhelmingly so. A large first strike advantage for the receiver makes linkage more likely.},

@article{Koremenos2013,
abstract = {This article introduces the Continent of International Law (COIL) research project on international agreement design. COIL stems from the conviction that the International Organization subfield's focus on the couple hundred international organizations with physical headquarters had to be broadened to include the tens of thousands extant international agreements, that is, international law. Each piece of international law can and should be studied as an institution. Together, this set of institutions, which truly is a “continent,” is theoretically very interesting and empirically very diversified. COIL's basic theoretical premise is that international agreement design and comparison across agreements begins by understanding the underlying cooperation problem(s) the agreements are trying to solve. COIL identifies 12 distinct and recurrent cooperation problems, which may occur alone or in combinations. The data collection features a random sample of international agreements conditional on the issue areas of economics, environment, human rights, and security. The first large-n, systematic operationalization of the cooperation problems underlying real international agreements is highlighted, and descriptive statistics are presented – some of which challenge conventional wisdom. For instance, enforcement problems (Prisoner's Dilemma-like situations) are important, but far from universal, with 30{\%} of the agreements characterized by that underlying problem. The numerous and diverse COIL variables allow for a multi-dimensional operationalization of the difficult-to-measure concept of the “incomplete contract.” Hypotheses from contract theory are tested, confirming the appropriateness of the new measure, the weakness of measures based on number of pages, and most significant, the rationality and efficiency of the continent of international law. },

However, it is surprisingly difficult to demonstrate this relation empirically, as areas with greater numbers of crimes tend to hire more police. In order to resolve this simultaneity, we begin by exploring the structure of the financial relationship existing between state and local governments, arguing that variations in state tax rates can serve as an instrumental variable for local police numbers. Two-stage least square (2SLS) result show that the elasticity of police presence with respect to crime is about −1.1 for violent crime, and −0.9 for property crime. These results are mostly significant, and are more negative than those obtained under OLS. Overall, our estimations suggest that police does reduce crime.},

A common approach in both empirical and theoretical work on oil price shocks is to evaluate the response of macroeconomic aggregates to exogenous changes in the price of oil. Implicit in this approach is a thought experiment, in which one varies the price of oil, while holding all other variables constant. This thought experiment is not well defined for two reasons. First, reverse causality from macro aggregates to oil prices means that cause and effect are no longer well defined when relating changes in the real price of oil to macroeconomic outcomes (see Robert B. Barsky and Kilian 2002). Second, the price of oil (like the price of any other commodity) is driven by distinct demand and supply shocks. Not only does each of these shocks have different dynamic effects on the real price of oil and hence on the US economy, but global demand shocks, in particular, may have direct effects on the US economy as well as an indirect effect working through the price of oil (and the prices of other industrial commodities). This fact immediately invalidates the ceteris paribus assumption, even controlling for reverse causality. This paper proposes a structural VAR model of the global crude oil market that jointly addresses these two issues. The first objective is to identify the underlying demand and supply shocks in the global crude oil market. The identification of these shocks is important not just for explaining fluctuations in the real price of oil, but also for understanding the response of the US economy associated with oil price fluctuations. Using a newly developed measure of monthly global real economic activity, a structural decomposition of the real price of crude oil into three components is proposed: crude oil supply shocks; shocks to the global demand for all industrial commodities; and demand shocks that are specific to the global crude oil market. The last shock is designed to capture shifts in the price of oil driven by higher precautionary demand associated with market concerns about the availability of future oil supplies. The paper provides estimates of the dynamic effects of these shocks on the real price of oil and estimates of how much each of these shocks contributed to the evolution of the real price of oil during the 1975-2007 period. The central message of this paper is that oil price increases may have very different effects on the real price of oil, depending on the underlying cause of the price increase. For example, an increase in precautionary demand for crude oil causes an immediate, persistent, and large increase in the real price of crude oil; an increase in aggregate demand for all industrial com modities causes a somewhat delayed, but sustained, increase in the real price of oil that is also substantial; and crude oil production disruptions cause a small and transitory increase in the real},

abstract = {We investigate the role of competitive transport markets in shaping the location of economic activity and the pattern of trade. In our model, carriers supply transport services for shipping manufactured goods, and freight rates are set to clear transport markets. Each carrier must commit to the maximum capacity for a round-trip and thus faces a logistics problem as there are opportunity costs of returning empty. These costs increase the freight rates charged to firms located in regions that are net exporters of manufactured goods. Since demand for transport services depends on the spatial distribution of economic activity, the concentration of production in one region raises freight rates to serve foreign markets from there, thus working against specialization and the agglomeration of firms. Consequently, a more even spatial distribution of firms and production prevails at equilibrium when freight rates are endogenously determined than when they are assumed to be exogenous as in the literature.},

The nature of dominant coalitions in both countries provides a conceptual anchor for understanding the links between internal and external politics in 1914 and 2014. Coalitional dynamics draw greater attention to agency in debates that all too often emphasize structure, impersonal forces, and inevitability. Two core claims rest on this basic analytical building block. First, despite apparent similarities in domestic coalitional arrangements of putative revisionist challengers—Germany and China—important differences defy facile analogies. China now is not Germany then. Second, the regional coalitional cluster and the global political economy—and hence the links between domestic and external politics—differ across the two periods.

abstract = {In this chapter, we examine how some of the main results in international trade theory fare when we abandon the traditional assumption of third-party enforcement of property rights. Without such enforcement, countries arm and exercise power to secure resources used in production or to secure the output from that production. Because arming is endogenous and takes scarce resources to produce, the production of final goods is also endogenous. Consequently, prices in either domestic or international markets reflect not only preferences, endowments or technologies of production as predicted by traditional models, but also arming and the power that comes from that. As we show in the context of a Ricardian model, those countries that produce the most socially valued goods tend to arm less, giving them a " comparative disadvantage " in power. Accordingly, the level of welfare obtained by these countries could be lower than that obtained in a competitive economy with perfect security. In the context of a Heckscher-Ohlin model, we find that free trade need not be preferred to autarky, as the costs of conflict or self-enforcement swamp the familiar gains from trade for a certain range of world prices. Finally, trade in the shadow of power can distort comparative advantage.},

How economically powerful does a state need to be before it can afford the capital intensive technologies, foreign bases, and military and logistical forces associated with global power projection? The specific research question we focus on in this article is: What determines how far states send their military forces? We argue that as the costs associated with projecting power decrease or as the wealth necessary to project power increases, states will project power more frequently and at greater distances. We use a system level time series analysis from 1870-1936 and a dispute level analysis on all militarized international disputes from 1870-2000 to test these propositions. This article is the first to demonstrate empirically that the distance and frequency of power projection is a function of the cost of projecting power. We close with a discussion of contemporary states building power projection capabilities and how future research might build from our research to explain this behavior.},

Information frictions explain the empirical failure of price arbitrage and provide new in- sight into how market conditions affect trade flows. Using a data set I assemble on regional agricultural trade in the Philippines, I show that observed trade flows and prices suggest the presence of substantial information frictions. I then structurally estimate the model to disentangle information frictions from transportation costs. I find that (1) estimated transportation costs are half as large as those implied by complete information models and more consistent with observed freight costs; and (2) the vast majority (93 percent) of the “gravity” relationship between trade flows and distance can be attributed to information frictions rather than transportation costs.},

abstract = {How large are the benefits of transportation infrastructure projects, and what explains these benefits? This paper uses archival data from colonial India to investigate the impact of India's vast railroad network. Guided by four results from a general equilibrium trade model, I find that railroads: (1) decreased trade costs and interregional price gaps; (2) increased interregional and international trade; (3) increased real income levels; and (4) that a sufficient statistic for the effect of railroads on welfare in the model accounts well for the observed reduced-form impact of railroads on real income in the data. (JEL H54, L92, N75, O22, R12, R42) In 2007, almost 20 percent of World Bank lending was allocated to transportation infrastructure projects, a larger share than that of education, health, and social services combined (World Bank 2007). These projects aim to reduce the costs of trading. In prominent models of international and interregional trade, reductions in trade costs will increase the level of real income in trading regions. Unfortunately, despite an emphasis on reducing trade costs in both economic theory and contemporary aid efforts, we lack a rigorous empirical understanding of the extent to which transportation infrastructure projects actually reduce the costs of trading, and how the resulting trade cost reductions affect welfare. In this paper I exploit one of history's great transportation infrastructure projects , the vast network of railroads built in colonial India (India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh-henceforth, simply "India"), to make three contributions to our understanding of transportation infrastructure improvements. In doing so I draw on a},

abstract = {While emotions are widely regarded as integral to the " behavioral approach " to International Relations (IR), a host of fundamental problems have delayed the integration of affective influences into traditional models of IR. We aim to integrate affect by focusing on commitment problems, a body of work that contains strong theoretical predictions about how individual decision makers will and should act. Across two lab experiments, we use a novel experimental protocol that includes a psychophysiological measure of emotional arousal (skin conductance reactivity) to study how individuals react to changes in bargaining power. While we find support for one key pillar of IR theory—individuals do reject offers when they expect the opponent's power to increase—we also find that physiological arousal tampers with individuals' ability to think strategically in the manner predicted by canonical models. Our follow-up experiment mimics the elements of institutional solutions to commitment problems and finds support for their efficacy on the individual level. Our novel findings suggest that when individuals face large power shifts, emotional arousal short-circuits their ability to " think forward and induct backwards, " suggesting that emotionally aroused individuals are less prone to commitment problems. Although emotions play an " obvious and omnipresent role in world politics, " several factors have delayed IR scholars from integrating affective influences into more trad-itional frameworks of international relations. 1 First, despite some early forays, emo-tions seem to have only recently been accepted as part of " mainstream " IR. In this way, the progress in our field has largely mirrored that of psychology, where theories of cognition and processing operated for many decades in isolation from theories of affect. Second has been the practical difficulty of examining emotions, leading to a proliferation of helpful theoretical pieces but little in the way of systematic evidence. 2 While researchers have caught on quickly, the new generation of emotion research in We are especially grateful to Ariya Hagh and Anna Oltman, and the team at the Harvard Decision Science Laboratory for facilitating this research, including 1. Bleiker and Hutchison 2008, 115. 2.

I show that the higher the informed player's payoff from war, the higher is his or her equilibrium payoff from settling the dispute short of war, and the higher is the equilibrium probability of war. The latter result rationalizes the monotonicity assumption prevalent in numerous expected utility models of war.

As globalization and democratization advance, theories and empirical models of international politics have become more complicated. We present a systematic theor- etical categorization of relationships between domestic and systemic variables. We use this categorization so that scholars can match their theory to the appropriate empir- ical model and assess the degree to which systemic factors affect their arguments. We also present two advances at the frontier of these empirical models. In one, we combine hierarchical models of moderating relationships with spatial models of interde- pendence among units within a system. In the other, we provide a model for analyzing spatial interdependence that varies over time. This enables us to examine how the level of interdependence among units has evolved. We illustrate our categorization and new models by revisiting the recent international political economy (IPE) debate over the re- lationship between trade policy and regime type in developing countries.},

This new bipo-lar competition is not inevitable. The key question is whether both governments have the self-restraint to limit domestic rent-seeking interests who will undoubtedly demand protection at home and exclusivity in their spheres of influence abroad. If not, the new superpowers will, like great powers in the past, 'race' for economic privileges that can quickly divide the world up into exclusive blocs. Like the security dilemma, great powers need not actually exclude one another from their economic zones; the fear of exclusion alone is enough to ignite the process of division. There was always some likelihood of a competitive economic spiral given China's close business-government relations in a 'state-capitalist' economy. Now, for the first time in seven decades, there is a chance that the United States, in the grips of economic nationalism, might abandon its historic policy of free trade and ignite a new race for economic privilege as well.},

The paper investigates the conditions under which mercantilism is adopted as a substitute for taxation when fiscal capacity is weak, when mercantilist revenue is reinvested in devel-oping fiscal capacity, and when economies endogenously abandon mercantilist practices and embrace free trade. If mercantilism is pursued when the stock of fiscal capacity is too low, the economy eventually falls into a protectionist trap, characterized by low income and low taxes. If mer-cantilism is adopted when the initial stock is large enough, then mercantilist revenue is invested in the expansion of the fiscal bureaucracy of the state. Eventually, the economy moves from the mercantilist-equilibrium to the free trade-equilibrium, where both income and taxes are high. The empirical implications of the model are examined against historical European data from 1820 to 1950.},

abstract = {We provide an equilibrium analysis of the efficiency properties of bilateral tariff negotiations in a three-country, two-good general equilibrium model of international trade when transfers are not feasible. We consider "weak-rules" settings characterized by two cases: a no-rules case in which discriminatory tariffs are allowed, and an MFN-only case in which negotiated tariffs must be non-discriminatory (i.e., satisfy the MFN rule). We allow for a general family of political-economic country welfare functions and assess efficiency relative to these welfare functions. For the no-rules case with discriminatory tariffs, we consider simultaneous bilateral tariff negotiations and utilize the "Nash-in-Nash" solution concept of Horn and Wolinsky (1988). We establish a sense in which the resulting tariffs are inefficient and too low, so that excessive liberalization occurs from the perspective of the three countries. In the MFN-only case, we consider negotiations between two countries that are "principal suppliers" to each other and employ the Nash bargaining solution concept. Different possibilities arise. For one important situation, we establish a sense in which the resulting tariffs are inefficient and too high when evaluated relative to the unrestricted set of efficient tariffs. We also compare the negotiated tariffs under the MFN rule with the MFN-constrained efficiency frontier, finding that the negotiated tariffs are generically inefficient relative to this frontier and may lead to too little or too much liberalization. Finally, we illustrate our findings with a numerical analysis of a particular representation of the model as an endowment economy with Cobb-Douglas preferences and under the assumption that each government maximizes the indirect utility of the representative agent in its country.},

abstract = {Can issue linkage, the combining of multiple issues into a single agreement, enhance the credibility of an agreement? I use the alliance relations of buffer states (states located between two recently or currently warring rivals) to test the claim that issue linkage enhances compliance with treaty obligations. The alliance rela- tions of buffer states create a ‘‘hard case'' for treaty compliance because, by being prone to invasion and occupation, buffer states have difficulties inducing states to remain committed to an alliance agreement. Hence, if linkage provisions can enhance the credibility of alliance commitments for buffer states, then linkage provisions should improve treaty compliance in nearly any context. I find that buffer states in alliances with trade provisions experience fewer opportunistic violations of the alliance terms, avoid occupation and invasion at a higher rate, and experience fewer third-party attacks than buffer states in other alliance arrangements.},

Estimation of a simultaneous equation switching regression model allows us to examine which market structure better characterizes the world oil market during the 1974–2004 period and to test whether switches between collusive and non-cooperative behaviour occurred. The null hypothesis that no switch occurred is rejected in favour of the alternative that both cooperative and non-cooperative behaviour was observed. We find that, although there were periods in which oil prices were measurably higher owing to collusion among OPEC members, overall OPEC has not been effective in systematically raising prices above Cournot competition levels. Our results suggest that, on average over the period of study, OPEC's behaviour is best described as Cournot competition in the face of a competitive fringe constituted by non-OPEC producers.},

abstract = {Themajority of labor transactions throughout much of history and a significant frac- tion of such transactions in many developing countries today are “coercive,” in the sense that force or the threat of force plays a central role in convincing workers to accept employment or its terms.We propose a tractable principal–agent model of co- ercion, based on the idea that coercive activities by employers, or “guns,” affect the participation constraint of workers.We show that coercion and effort are complements, so that coercion increases effort, but coercion always reduces utilitarian social welfare. Better outside options for workers reduce coercion because of the complementarity between coercion and effort: workers with a better outside option exert lower effort in equilibrium and thus are coerced less. Greater demand for labor increases coercion because it increases equilibrium effort. We investigate the interaction between out- side options, market prices, and other economic variables by embedding the (coercive) principal–agent relationship in a general equilibrium setup, and studying when and how labor scarcity encourages coercion. General (market) equilibrium interactions working through the price of output lead to a positive relationship between labor scarcity and coercion along the lines of ideas suggested by Domar, while interactions those working through the outside option lead to a negative relationship similar to ideas advanced in neo-Malthusian historical analyses of the decline of feudalism. In net, a decline in available labor increases coercion in general equilibrium if and only if its direct (partial equilibrium) effect is to increase the price of output by more than it increases outside options. Our model also suggests that markets in slaves make slaves worse off, condi- tional on enslavement, and that coercion is more viable in industries that do not require relationship-specific investment by workers.},

abstract = {We present a general model of legislative bargaining in which the status quo is an arbitrary point in a multidimensional policy space. In contrast to other bargaining mod- els, the status quo is not assumed to be “bad,” and delay may be Pareto efficient. We prove existence of stationary equilibria. The possibility of equilibrium delay depends on four factors: risk aversion of the legislators, the dimensionality of the policy space, the voting rule, and the possibility of transfers across districts. If legislators are risk averse, if there is more than one policy dimension, and if voting is by majority rule, for example, then delay will almost never occur. In one dimension, delay is possible if and only if the status quo lies in the core of the voting rule, and then it is the only possible outcome. This “core selection” result yields a game-theoretic foundation for the well-known median voter theorem. Our comparative statics analysis yield two noteworthy insights: (i) if the status quo is close to the core, then equilibrium policy outcomes will also be close to the core (a moderate status quo produces moderate policy outcomes), and (ii) if legislators are patient, then equilibrium proposals will be close to the core (legislative patience leads to policy moderation).},

They tend not to embody dynamic changes, focusing rather on static slices of behavior over time across a single relational dimension. These models have also been empirically evaluated in ways that assumed the independence of each country, when in reality they are searching for the interdependence among all countries. A number of approaches are available now for analyzing relational data such as international conflict in a network context and a number of these can even handle longitudinal relational data, but none are developed to the point of exploring how networks can coevolve over time. We illustrate a solution to the limitations of existing approaches and apply this novel, dynamic, network based approach to study the dependencies among the ebb and flow of daily international interactions using a newly developed, and openly available, database of events among nations.},

abstract = {Is it possible to trade with bandits? When government is absent, the superior strength of some agents makes it cheaper for them to violently steal what they desire from weaker agents than to use trade to obtain what they want. Such was the case with middlemen who interacted with producers in late precolonial west central Africa. In the face of this threat, producers employed two mech-anisms to make exchange with middlemen possible. On the one hand, they used credit to alter middlemen's cost-benefit structure of engaging in plunder versus trade. On the other hand, producers demanded tribute from traveling traders as a risk premium. By transforming traveling traders' incentive from banditry to peaceful trade and reducing producers' costs associated with inter-acting with middlemen, these mechanisms enhanced both parties' ability to capture the gains from exchange. How wonderful is commerce. (David Livingstone [1963, p. 32], nineteenth-century British explorer of the remote interior of west central Africa)},

I construct a multi-country, general equilibrium model of trade and derive tractable predictions that show how specialization affects relative prices. I calibrate the model to match the patterns of prices, levels of development, and bilateral trade across 103 countries. Through counterfactuals I find that removing trade barriers eliminates more than half of the gap in the relative price of services between rich and poor countries with only a minimal systematic effect on the absolute price of tradables.},

If the answer is common interests, what conditions give rise to these common interests? I develop a theory in which the economic conflict of interests between two states is determined by the consequences of a coerced transfer of wealth from one to the other. This transfer may induce costly distortions in the targeted economy, which may diffuse to the co-ercing state's economy. If the coercing government internalizes these diffused costs, its incentive to seek a transfer will be reduced. Nations with representative polities and " modern " economies—which are sensitive to transfers and integrated—thus have less to fight over. An empirical estimate suggests the theorized reduction in incentives for transfers is plausibly large enough in the West to explain its unusual peacefulness.},

We use annual data from 1990 through 2001 from 2074 cities with populations in excess of 10,000 to show that for each officer paid for by grant funds, the size of the force expands by 0.70 officers. The size of COPS grants are correlated with population and crime rates, but not the pre-COPS time trends in crime rates or the size of the police force. This allows us to use the size of COPS grants as an instrument for the size of the police force in regressions where crime is the outcome of interest. These models indicate that police added to the force by COPS generated statistically significant reductions in auto thefts, burglaries, robberies, and aggravated assaults.},

The model implies a modified Hotelling rule for drilling revenues net of costs and explains why production is typically constrained. It also rationalizes regional production peaks and observed patterns of price expectations following demand shocks.},

We embed a multi-sector model of trade between multiple countries into a model of interconnected bilateral negotiations over tariffs. Using 1990 trade flows and tariff outcomes from the Uruguay Round of GATT/WTO negotiations, we estimate country-sector productivity levels, sector-level productivity dispersion, iceberg trade costs, and country-pair bargaining parameters. We use the estimated model to simulate an alternative institutional setting for multilateral tariff negotiations in which the most-favored-nation requirement is abandoned. We find that abandonment of the most-favored-nation requirement would result in inefficient over-liberalization of tariffs and a deterioration in worldwide welfare relative to the negotiated outcomes in the presence of the most-favored-nation requirement.},

This paper models a mutually assured destruction (MAD) crisis as a game of sequential bargaining with incomplete information, sufficiently simple that its equibria may be found. These provide better game-theoretic foundations for the notions of resolve and critical risk and their role in crises and also make it possible to compare the bargaining dynamics of this model with those of descriptively richer, but incompletely specified models, revealing several inconsistencies: several analyses of MAD conclude that the state with the greatest resolve in this contest of resolve will prevail. Many models based on critical risks suggest that a state is less likely to escalate, the greater its adversary's resolve. In our model, however, the state with the weakest resolve sometimes prevails, and some states prove more likely to escalate if their adversaries' resolve is greater.},

abstract = {A large class of models with CES utility and iceberg trade costs are now known to generate isomorphic “gravity equations.” Economic interpretations of these gravity equations vary in terms of two basic elements: the exporter's “mass” variable and the elasticity of trade with respect to true ad valorem “trade costs.” In this paper, we offer three potential contributions. First, we formulate and estimate a structural gravity equation based on the standard Krugman model of monopolistic competition and increasing returns. In the context of this model, a key parameter, the elasticity of substitution in consumption ($\sigma$), can be estimated precisely – even without observable true ad valorem trade-cost measures – using exporter's population and observable variables that influence trade costs. Second, in the empirical context of the well-known McCallum Canadian–U.S. “border puzzle,” our approach – allowing estimation of $\sigma$ – yields considerably different general equilibrium comparative static trade-flow and economic welfare effects than those in an Armington endowment economy and assumed values of $\sigma$. Moreover, our predicted trade flows and GDPs are highly correlated with their respective observed values in the case of bilaterally symmetric or asymmetric Canadian–U.S. border effects. Third, a Monte Carlo analysis confirms unbiased and precise estimates of all coefficients, the elasticity of substitution, and comparative statics using our approach.},

abstract = {Has globalization diluted the power of national governments to regulate their own economies? Are international governmental and nongovernmental organizations weakening the hold of nation-states on global regulatory agendas? Many observers think so. But in All Politics Is Global, Daniel Drezner argues that this view is wrong. Despite globalization, states--especially the great powers--still dominate international regulatory regimes, and the regulatory goals of states are driven by their domestic interests. As Drezner shows, state size still matters. The great powers--the United States and the European Union--remain the key players in writing global regulations, and their power is due to the size of their internal economic markets. If they agree, there will be effective global governance. If they don't agree, governance will be fragmented or ineffective. And, paradoxically, the most powerful sources of great-power preferences are the least globalized elements of their economies. Testing this revisionist model of global regulatory governance on an unusually wide variety of cases, including the Internet, finance, genetically modified organisms, and intellectual property rights, Drezner shows why there is such disparity in the strength of international regulations. {\textcopyright} 2007 by Princeton University Press.

abstract = {Westphalia s Abstract Some contemporary states seem subject to aggregational dynamics that bring them together in larger regional associations, whereas others fall prey to cen-trifugal forces that pull them apart. The autonomy of all states has been drawn into question by the globalization of trade and finance. For these reasons, scholars have returned to examining the historical origins and development of the modern state in the hope that this may shed light on its future, and on the process through which new logics of organization may be emerging that might displace the state. This essay discusses various accounts of the emergence and development of the modern state, comparing security, economic, and institutionalist approaches. It then links these approaches to insights regarding contemporary statehood. Arguments regarding the autonomy of the state must be distinguished from discussions of territorial sovereignty as a constitutive principle of international relations. The latter, juridical notion of sovereignty as a regu-lative device in international relations has retained its influence, even if the autonomy of the state has declined.},

@article{Baldwin2016,
abstract = {W hen the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was signed by 23 nations in 1947, the goal was to establish a rules-based world trading system and to facilitate mutually advantageous trade liberalization. As the GATT evolved over time and morphed into the World Trade Organization in 1993, both goals have largely been achieved. The WTO presides over a rule-based trading system based on norms that are almost universally accepted and respected by its 163 members. Tariffs today are below 5 percent on most trade, and zero for a very large share of imports. Despite its manifest success, the WTO is widely regarded as suffering from a deep malaise. The main reason is that the latest WTO negotiation, the Doha Round, has staggered between failures, flops, and false dawns since it was launched in 2001. But the Doha logjam has not inhibited tariff liberalization-far from it. During the last 15 years, most WTO members have massively lowered barriers to trade, investment , and services bilaterally, regionally, and unilaterally-indeed, everywhere except through the WTO. The massive tariff cutting that has taken place around the world, shown in Table 1, has been at least as great as in the previous successful WTO rounds. Moreover, the Doha gridlock has also not dampened nations' interest in the WTO; 20 nations, including China and Russia, have joined since 2001. This paper begins by sketching the historical context of the original GATT agreement. It then discusses how the rules and principles behind the GATT rounds},

abstract = {Why do great powers fear oil coercion, and what explains the strategies they adopt to protect themselves from it? The paper iden-tifies three types of anticipatory strategies great powers pursue: self-sufficiency, indirect control, and direct control. A state's choice of strategy depends on its degree of vulnerability to oil coercion, which in turn is determined by two independent variables: the amount of oil the country possesses compared to what it needs to meet strategic objectives and the susceptibility of its imports to physical disrup-tion. Great powers fear oil coercion not only because they worry about damage to their economies; petroleum denial also threat-ens a country's military capabilities. Four case studies illustrate the theory, including Great Britain's efforts to reduce coercive vulnera-bility at the close of the First World War and Adolf Hitler's attempts across three periods to safeguard German oil access before and during World War II. Mention the " oil weapon " and the 1973 Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) embargo often leaps to mind, complete with its iconic images of long lines at American gasoline stations. 1 Yet, international oil coercion, a strategy that aims to change an opponent's political behavior by threatening its access to petroleum, rarely resembles the OAPEC oil crisis, and its use long predates 1973. 2 The unfortunate overemphasis on this single, Rosemary A.

A government is formed when the policy proposed by the part selected is sustained on a vote of confidence. The equilibria identify the government and the policy it will implement and depend on the configuration of preferences and on the government formation process. For example, in a political system with two large parties and one small party and in which one of the two large parties will be selected to attempt to form a government, the government will be formed by a large party with the support of the small party. The policy will reflect the preferences of the small party but will be closer to the ideal point of the large party.},

If power declines in distance, then power relations between two nations differ at different points on the globe. Claims about the impact of parity or preponderance on conflict and peace then really only apply to particular points or regions in the space separating borders or national capitals. We use a formal bargaining model to demonstrate that dyads should be most prone to fight in places where each state's capabilities, discounted by distance, are roughly at parity. We then assess this relationship empirically, introducing the directed dyad year location unit-of-analysis to capture the impact of geographic distance on power and the propensity to fight. With roughly 1 × 10 11 observations, it is not practical to construct the actual dataset. Instead, we combine all dispute locations with a random sample of non-dispute locations, correcting for bias during estimation. Results confirm that disputes are most likely at locations where the distance-weighted capabilities of nations are roughly equal.},

With statistics of various definitions of polarization, we find little increase in the dispersion of views in the public from 1956 to 2012 but do find an increase in ideological sorting starting around 1980. The two time series bear little resemblance to one another with respect to divergence. Further, while congressional sorting exceeds that in the public today, we find that Congress has always been unrepresentative of the public. These results suggest that it is unlikely that changes in public preferences alone explain the widening gulf between the two parties in Congress.},

abstract = {For some time now there has been con-siderable skepticism about the ability of comparative cost theory to explain the ac-tual pattern of international trade. Neither the extensive trade among the industrial countries, nor the prevalence in this trade of two-way exchanges of differentiated prod-ucts, make much sense in terms of standard theory. As a result, many people have con-cluded that a new framework for analyzing trade is needed.' The main elements of such a framework-economies of scale, the pos-sibility of product differentiation, and im-perfect competition-have been discussed by such authors as Bela Balassa, Herbert Grubel (1967,1970), and Irving Kravis, and have been "in the air" for many years. In this paper I present a simple formal analysis which incorporates these elements, and show how it can be used to shed some light on some issues which cannot be handled in more conventional models. These include, in particular, the causes of trade between economies with similar factor endowments, and the role of a large domestic market in encouraging exports. The basic model of this paper is one in which there are economies of scale in pro-duction and firms can costlessly differenti-ate their products. In this model, which is derived from recent work by Avinash Dixit and Joseph Stiglitz, equilibrium takes the form of Chamberlinian monopolistic com-petition: each firm has some monopoly power, but entry drives monopoly profits to zero. When two imperfectly competitive economies of this kind are allowed to trade, increasing returns produce trade and gains from trade even if the economies have iden-tical tastes, technology, and factor endow-ments. This basic model of trade is pre-sented in Section I. It is closely related to a model I have developed elsewhere; in this paper a somewhat more restrictive formula-tion of demand is used to make the analysis in later sections easier. The rest of the paper is concerned with two extensions of the basic model. In Sec-tion II, I examine the effect of transporta-tion costs, and show that countries with larger domestic markets will, other things equal, have higher wage rates. Section III then deals with "home market" effects on trade patterns. It provides a formal justifica-tion for the commonly made argument that countries will tend to export those goods for which they have relatively large domestic markets. This paper makes no pretense of general-ity. The models presented rely on extremely restrictive assumptions about cost and util-ity. Nonetheless, it is to be hoped that the paper provides some useful insights into those aspects of international trade which simply cannot be treated in our usual models. I. The Basic Model},

abstract = {We develop a dynamic trade model with spatially distinct labor markets facing varying ex-posure to international trade. The model captures the role of labor mobility frictions, goods mobility frictions, geographic factors, and input-output linkages in determining equilibrium al-locations. We show how to solve the equilibrium of the model and take the model to the data without assuming that the economy is at a steady state and without estimating productivities, migration frictions, or trade costs, which can be di¢ cult to identify. We calibrate the model to 22 sectors, 38 countries, and 50 U.S. states. We study how the rise in China's trade for the period 2000 to 2007 impacted U.S. households across more than a thousand U.S. labor markets distinguished by sector and state. We {\ldots}nd that the China trade shock resulted in a loss of 0.8 million U.S. manufacturing jobs, about 25{\%} of the observed decline in manufacturing em-ployment from 2000 to 2007. The U.S. gains in the aggregate but, due to trade and migration frictions, the welfare and employment e¤ects vary across U.S. labor markets. Estimated transi-tion costs to the new long-run equilibrium are also heterogeneous and re ect the importance of accounting for labor dynamics.},

A policy of paving roads raises aggregate productivity (4.9 percent) and the median farmer's welfare (2.7 percent), but increased competition from remote suppliers harms 20 percent of farmers.

abstract = {Consider a network where the nodes split into K different communities. The community labels for the nodes are unknown and it is of major interest to estimate them (i.e., community detection). Degree Corrected Block Model (DCBM) is a popular network model. How to detect communities with the DCBM is an interesting problem, where the main challenge lies in the degree heterogeneity. We propose a new approach to community detection which we call the Spectral Clustering On Ratios-of-Eigenvectors (SCORE). Compared to classical spectral methods, the main innovation is to use the entry-wise ratios between the first leading eigenvector and each of the other leading eigenvectors for clustering. Let A be the adjacency matrix of the network. We first obtain the K leading eigenvectors of A, say, ˆ $\eta$ 1 ,. .. , ˆ $\eta$ K , and letˆRletˆ letˆR be the n× (K − 1) matrix such thatˆRthatˆ thatˆR(i, k) = ˆ $\eta$ k+1 (i)/ ˆ $\eta$ 1 (i), 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ K − 1. We then us{\^{e}} R for clustering by applying the k-means method. The central surprise is, the effect of degree heterogeneity is largely ancillary , and can be effectively removed by taking entry-wise ratios betweenˆ$\eta$ betweenˆ betweenˆ$\eta$ k+1 andˆ$\eta$andˆ andˆ$\eta$ 1 , 1 ≤ k ≤ K − 1. The method is successfully applied to the web blogs data and the karate club data, with error rates of 58/1222 and 1/34, respectively. These results are more satisfactory than those by the classical spectral methods. Additionally , compared to modularity methods, SCORE is easier to implement, com-putationally faster, and also has smaller error rates. We develop a theoretic framework where we show that under mild conditions , the SCORE stably yields consistent community detection. In the core of the analysis is the recent development on Random Matrix Theory (RMT), where the matrix-form Bernstein inequality is especially helpful.},

abstract = {Conventional wisdom holds that autocracies are more likely than democracies to adopt interventionist and protectionist economic policies, including fixed and undervalued exchange rates. This article suggests that this view is only partially correct: nondemocracies are a heterogeneous grouping, and only some types of authoritarian regimes adopt different foreign economic policies from those of their democratic counterparts. Using the example of exchange rate policy, the authors show that foreign economic policy varies across monarchic, military, and civilian dictatorships. More specifically, they hypothesize that monarchies and military regimes are more likely than democracies and civilian dictatorships to maintain fixed exchange rate regimes because the former regimes have smaller “selectorates” than the latter. The authors also expect that monarchies and civilian dictatorships maintain more undervalued exchange rates than democracies and military regimes because the former regimes provide their leaders with greater tenure security than the latter regimes. These hypotheses are evaluated using a time-series–cross-sectional data set of a large sample of developing countries from 1973 to 2006. The statistical results accord with these predictions. These findings indicate that the ways in which democracies engage with the global economy may be less unique than many believe.},

abstract = {Social scientists increasingly rely on statistical models of text to resolve a wide range of questions about speech across a range of domains. However, humans communicate with more than text alone. Auditory cues convey important information, such as emotion, in many contexts of interest to social scientists. Nonetheless, researchers typically discard this information and work only with transcriptions of audio data. We develop the Structural Speaker Affect Model (SSAM), to classify auditorily distinct "modes" of speech (e.g., emotions, speakers) and the transitions between them. SSAM incorporates ridge-like regularization into a nested hidden Markov model, allowing the use of high-dimensional audio features. We implement a fast estimation procedure that enables a principled approach to uncertainty based on the Bayesian bootstrap. As a validation test, we show that SSAM markedly outperforms existing audio and text approaches in both (a) identifying individual Supreme Court justices and (b) detecting human-labeled "skepticism" in their speech. We extend the analysis by examining the dynamics of expressed emotion in oral arguments.},

abstract = {The authors appraise a well-known argument connecting economics and security in international relations: military allies are likely to trade more with one another than non-allies. A review of alliance treaties and diplomatic history suggests that, under certain conditions, states may tie together alliance agreements and economic agreements. When states explicitly link alliance agreements with economic cooperation, one would expect to see increased economic exchange coinciding with coordinated security policies. This article evaluates whether the linking of economic and security agreements accounts for a positive relationship between alliances and trade among European states before World War II and produces evidence in support of this argument. Trade among allies who have specified economic cooperation in their alliance agreements is higher than trade among non-allied states and higher than trade among allies who have not promised economic cooperation. In contrast, trade among allies without specific economic provisions in their treaties is statistically no different from trade among non-allies. Thus, the positive empirical relationship between alliances and trade that the authors find in pre-WWII Europe is a result of only a specific subset of all military alliances, namely, those treaties that stipulate economic cooperation between the allies. This study advances our understanding of the alliancetrade relationship by focusing attention on the joint negotiation of cooperation in different issue-areas.},

abstract = {This paper explores if scarcity increases violence in markets without a centralized authority. We construct a model in which, by raising prices and revenues, tempo-ral supply shortages foster violence. Guided by our model, we examine the link between scarcity and violence in the Mexican cocaine trade. Scarcity created by co-caine seizures in Colombia—Mexico's main supplier—increases violence in Mexico, especially in municipalities near the US border, in municipalities that have multiple cartels, and in municipalities that have strong PAN support—the party that has spearheaded the crackdown on the cocaine trade since 2006. Our estimates imply that, between 2006 and 2009, the sharp decline in the cocaine supply from Colom-bian could account for 10{\%} to 14{\%} of the increase in violence in Mexico and 25{\%} of the differential increase in the North of Mexico relative to the rest of the country., as well as seminar participants at Universidad de los Andes, Stanford, UCLA, ITAM and the AL CAPONE and LACEA meetings for their very helpful comments and suggestions.

We use a micro-founded heterogeneous-consumers model to estimate the impact of national borders on global and regional trade flows. Results show that difficulties faced by developing countries' exporters in accessing developed markets are 50{\%} higher than those faced by Northern exporters. These difficulties have however experienced a noticeable fall since 1980 in all industries. It is twenty three times easier to enter Northern and Southern markets for a Southern country exporter in 2006 than in 1980. Expressed in tariff-equivalent, the level of protection implied when crossing a border fell from 180{\%} to 89{\%} for this same sample. While tariffs still have an influence on trade patterns, they do not seem to explain an important part of the border effect. Last, our theory-based measure offers a renewal of the assessment of the impact of regional trading arrangements. The EU, NAFTA, ASEAN and MERCOSUR agreements all tend to reduce the estimated degree of market fragmentation within those zones, with the expected ranking between their respective trade impact.},

abstract = {Bargaining models play a central role in international relations, particularly in the study of conflict. A common criticism of this approach is that it fails to account for nonmaterial (e.g., psychological) factors that may influence the bargaining process. We augment a standard bargaining model by allowing actors' preferences over conflict to diverge from the “fitness” payoffs (e.g., resources) typical of such models. Preferences are subject to evolutionary forces—those who attain high fitness reproduce more. We find that (1) there is a trade-off where being “irrationally” tough leads to better bargains but also more inefficient conflict; (2) actors develop behavioral biases consistent with empirical findings from psychology and behavioral economics; and (3) these behavioral biases inevitably lead to conflict. By bridging the strategic and psychological approaches to conflict, our models provide new insights into questions such as how changes in military and intelligence-gathering technology affect the likelihood and expected cost of war, and how to interpret the purported decline of violence over recent human history.},

After disaggregating civil wars into irregular wars (or insurgencies), conventional wars, and symmetric nonconventional wars, we report a striking decline of irregular wars following the end of the Cold War, a remarkable transformation of internal conflict. Our analysis brings the international system back into the study of internal conflict. It specifies the connection between system polarity and the Cold War on the one hand and domestic warfare on the other hand. It also demonstrates that irregular war is not the paradigmatic mode of civil war as widely believed, but rather is closely associated with the structural characteristics of the Cold War.},

International organizations use one or a combination of three types of decision-making rules for most non-judicial action: "majoritarian" (decisions are taken by a majority vote of member states, and each member has one vote); "weighted voting" (decisions are taken by a majority or super-majority, with each state assigned votes or other procedural powers in proportion to its population, financial contribution to the organization, or other factors); or "sovereign equality." Organizations with these latter rules-which are rooted in a notion of sovereign equality of states derived from natural law theory and later adopted by positivists and others-formally negate status, offer equal representation and voting power in international organizations, and take decisions by consensus or unanimity of the members. 3},

abstract = {Drug trade-related violence has escalated dramatically in Mexico since 2007, and recent years have also witnessed large-scale efforts to combat trafficking, spearheaded by Mexico's conservative PAN party. This study examines the direct and spillover effects of Mexican policy toward the drug trade. Regression discontinuity estimates show that drug-related violence increases substantially after close elections of PAN mayors. Empirical evidence suggests that the vio-lence reflects rival traffickers' attempts to usurp territories after crackdowns have weakened incumbent criminals. Moreover, the study uses a network model of trafficking routes to show that PAN victories divert drug traffic, increasing violence along alternative drug routes. (JEL D72, D85, K42, O17, Z13) Violence related to the drug trade has escalated dramatically in Mexico since 2007, claiming over 60,000 lives and raising concerns about the capacity of the state to monopolize violence. Recent years have also witnessed large-scale efforts to combat drug trafficking, spearheaded by Mexico's conservative National Action Party (PAN). These efforts have cost around 9 billion USD per annum, nearly as much as the government expends on social development.},

abstract = {The United States has been at war for thirteen of the twenty-two years since the Cold War ended and the world became unipolar. Still, the consensual view among international relations theorists is that unipolarity is peaceful. They base this view on two assumptions: first, the unipole will guarantee the global status quo and, second, no state will balance against it. Both assumptions are problematic. First, the unipole may disengage from a particular region, thus removing constraints on regional conflicts. Second, if the unipole remains engaged in the world, those minor powers that decide not to accommodate it will be unable to find a great power sponsor. Placed in this situation of extreme self-help, they will try to revise the status quo in their favor, a dynamic that is likely to trigger conflict with the unipole. Therefore, neither the structure of a unipolar world nor U.S. strategic choices clearly benefit the overall prospects for peace. For the world as a whole, unipolarity makes conflict likely. F...},

We refer to theories in which one or more groups of agents ("coalitions") deliberately get together to jointly determine within-group actions, while interacting noncooperatively across groups. The chapter describes a variety of solution concepts, using an umbrella model that adopts an explicit real-time approach. Players band together, perhaps disband later and re-form in shifting alliances, all the while receiving payoffs at each date according to the coalition structure prevailing at the time. We use this model to nest two broad approaches to coalition formation, one based on cooperative game theory, the other based on noncooperative bargaining. Three themes that receive explicit emphasis are agent farsightedness, the description of equilibrium coalition structures, and the efficiency implications of the various theories.},

abstract = {Why is prohibition so seldom enforced? We propose that governments face a tradeoff between prohibition enforcement and peace. Using a model in which policy affects dynamic interaction among those trafficking an illegal good, we show that enforcing prohibition can increase profits---and that higher profits drive violence among traffickers, who invest more in fighting over a more valuable prize. Jailing or killing traffickers, while politically popular, makes them short-sighted and splinters criminal organizations, both of which increase violence. While previous models of illegal markets focus either on supply reduction or on violence, we consider both, revealing why prohibition is self-limiting: the government achieves one enforcement goal only at the cost of another.},

More specifically, it asks whether political-military alliances influenced in­ ternational trade expansion after World War II. Allies have especially strong interests in trading with each other and relatively weak concerns about cheating. This biases them to­ ward raising their trade with each other despite the explicit prohibition against discrimi­ nation in the GATT/WTO charter. Using data on trade flows between 1946 and 2003, I show that alliances do exert a positive impact on the trade of contracting parties, effec­ tively embedding discrimination in the postwar regime. Because international politics prompted de facto trade discrimination across its members, the GATT/WTO represented less of a clean break from the interwar system than is often assumed.},

abstract = {Motivated by recent developments in cyberwarfare, we study deterrence in a world where attacks cannot be perfectly attributed to attackers. In the model, each of n attackers may attack the defender. The defender observes an imperfect signal that probabilistically attributes the attack. The defender may retaliate against one or more attackers, and wants to retaliate against the guilty attacker only. We uncover an endogenous strategic complementarity among the attackers: if one attacker becomes more aggressive, that attacker becomes more " suspect " and the other attackers become less suspect, which leads the other attackers to become more aggressive as well. Improving the defender's ability to detect attacks or identify the source of attacks can hinder deterrence and lead to more attacks, but simultaneously improving both detection and identification—in that some attacks which previously went undetected are now both detected and unambiguously attributed—always reduces attacks. Deterrence is improved if the defender can commit to a retaliatory strategy in advance, but the defender should not always commit to retaliate more after every signal.},

This study tests this hypothesis on a new data set (an expansion of Fortna's (2004) data) of all periods of peace following interstate war cease-fires, over the period 1914-2001. It also tests for other possible factors affecting postwar peace duration, including international institutions, the revelation of information during war, third-party intervention during war, postwar changes in the balance of power, regime type, past conflict history, and others. The article finds strong support for the central hypothesis that peace lasts longer following wars that end in foreign-imposed regime change. This pacifying effect diminishes over time when a puppet is imposed, but not when a democracy is imposed. There are other results, including that the strength of a cease-fire agreement has almost no impact on peace duration.},

Recent applications include large data sets of various types including roll calls, surveys, and textual and social media data. To overcome the resulting computational challenges, we propose fast estimation methods for ideal points with massive data. We derive the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms to estimate the standard ideal point model with binary, ordinal, and continuous outcome variables. We then extend this methodology to dynamic and hierarchical ideal point models by developing variational EM algorithms for approximate inference. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and scalability of our methodology through a variety of real and simulated data. In cases where a standard Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm would require several days to compute ideal points, the proposed algorithm can produce essentially identical estimates within minutes. Open-source software is available for implementing the proposed methods.},

@article{Krainin2016,
abstract = {We present a dynamic, complete-information bargaining model of war with N countries. The analysis of a network with more than two countries significantly generalizes previous work. We consider an environment where a country's military strength varies stochastically over time as a function of endogenous consumption. If countries are sufficiently patient, then war is inevitable and will quickly spread throughout the network. We leverage insights from the limiting case to identify two key factors that promote peace among countries with limited patience: peace is easier to sustain when countries have equal military strength or when mechanisms exist to preserve any existing inequalities. Varying the number of countries does not have a consistent effect. A n important challenge for international relations the-orists is to understand what determines the stability of a system. Different international systems have experienced vastly different levels of conflict. The Congress of Vienna and the Cold War systems were markedly peace-ful compared to the systems that followed the Treaties of Utrecht (1713) and Rastatt (1714) and, even more disas-trously, the Treaty of Versailles (1919). Today, the Middle East experiences near-constant conflict, while other regions full of potential foes, like East Asia, remain tense but peace-ful. Why does a stable equilibrium (or peaceful balance of power) exist in one system but not in another? Wagner (2007) suggests that international systems are best understood in a bargaining model, where countries ne-gotiate how to share current and future resources. If the countries fail to agree on a peaceful split, war results. Thus, Wagner argues, the threat of war is the fundamental de-terminant of outcomes in a system. Previous work (includ-ing Fearon 1995; Leventoglu and Slantchev 2007; Powell 1999, 2004a, 2006; Wagner 2000) has developed models based on that framework for the case of two countries, but this article presents the first dynamic, N-country bargaining model of war. 1 (Alesina and Spolaore [2003, 2005] explore the static division of resources in a multicountry model without a mi-crofoundation of bargaining under the threat of war. Krainin [2014] considers a static, multicountry bargaining model.) In our model, the distribution of military power across coun-tries shifts stochastically over time as a function of endoge-nous consumption. These dynamic changes in power and the commitment problems that they engender are the cause of instability and war in our model. Countries cannot commit to future divisions of resources because there is no outside entity to enforce contracts. Therefore, as countries rise and fall in strength, a newly strong country cannot resist using its in-creased bargaining power to renegotiate any previous agree-ment to its own benefit. Anticipating that behavior, an ini-tially strong country may start a war in order to lock in its current advantage. The main result of our article is that when countries are sufficiently patient, then war is inevitable, and once it starts it will spread quickly throughout the network of countries—no international system is stable except the case of a single country. The details of our baseline model are as follows: in every period, N ≥ 2 countries divide and consume a fixed amount of resources. Each country has a level of military strength that varies over time according to a stochastic transition function that depends (as in Fearon 1996; Powell 2006, 185– 88) on that current consumption. In any period, a country can reject the peaceful division of resources and start a war against any country or countries with which it is connected},

abstract = {What factors determine firms' attitudes toward trade policy? This paper considers producers' policy preferences and political behavior in light of two key patterns in modern international trade: industries that face import competition often have many exporters, and foreign sales are concentrated in the hands of a small number of " superstar " exporters. Using a new survey of Costa Rican firms matched to systematic firm-level data on export behavior, we find that firm features are generally more important predictors of attitudes toward trade liberalization than industry-wide compar-ative advantage. We also show that export intensity is strongly associated with interest and lobbying activity on trade policy. The largest exporters, who are the strongest supporters of global integration, dominate trade politics. W hat factors determine firms' attitudes toward trade policy? And how do firms' characteristics shape their level of engagement and lobbying ac-tivity in the political process, where trade policy gets made? Reflecting the turn toward firms in the economics of trade, this paper provides an account of producer preferences over trade policy emphasizing two factors: the large numbers of ex-porters in " import-competing " industries and the overwhelm-ing domination of foreign sales by a small number of " su-perstar " exporters. These two factors are used to develop a series of predictions about how firm, rather than industry, characteristics shape attitudes toward trade liberalization and determine levels of political engagement on trade policy. These ideas are tested on a survey of Costa Rican firms matched to firm-level data on export performance. Our theory builds off of a small but growing literature on firm heterogeneity and trade politics, to which we contribute},

Controlling for crime, prior call patterns, and several neighborhood characteristics, we find that residents of Milwaukee's neighborhoods, especially residents of black neighborhoods, were far less likely to report crime after Jude's beating was broadcast. The effect lasted for over a year and resulted in a total net loss of approximately 22,200 calls for service. Other local and national cases of police violence against unarmed black men also had a significant impact on citizen crime reporting in Milwaukee. Police misconduct can powerfully suppress one of the most basic forms of civic engagement: calling 911 for matters of personal and public safety.},

Our focus is on the interaction between the scarcity of resources and the incentives for war in the presence of limited commitment. We show that a key parameter determining the incentives for war is the elasticity of demand. Our first result identifies a novel externality that can precipitate war: price-taking firms fail to internalize the impact of their extraction on military action. In the case of inelastic resource demand, war incentives increase over time andwar may become inevitable. Our secondresult shows that in some situations, regulation of prices and quantities by the resource-rich country can prevent war, and when this is the case, there will also be slower resource extraction than the Hotelling benchmark (with inelastic demand). Our third result is that because of limited commitment and its implications for armament incentives, regulation of prices and quantities might actually precipitate war even in some circumstances where wars would not have arisen under competitive markets.

abstract = {While much research in political economy points out the benefits of “limited government,” political scientists have long emphasized the problems created in many less-developed nations by “weak states,” which lack the power to tax and regulate the economy and to withstand the political and social challenges from non-state actors. I construct a model in which the state apparatus is controlled by a self-interested ruler, who tries to divert resources for his own consumption, but who can also invest in socially productive public goods. Both weak and strong states create distortions. When the state is excessively strong, the ruler imposes such high taxes that economic activity is stifled. When the state is excessively weak, the ruler anticipates that he will not be able to extract rents in the future and underinvests in public goods. I show that the same conclusion applies in the analysis of both the economic power of the state (i.e., its ability to raise taxes) and its political power (i.e., its ability to remain entrenched from the citizens). I also discuss how under certain circumstances a different type of equilibrium, which I refer to as “consensually strong state equilibrium,” can emerge whereby the state is politically weak but is allowed to impose high taxes as long as a sufficient fraction of the proceeds are invested in public goods. The consensually strong state might best correspond to the state in OECD countries where taxes are high despite significant control by the society over the government.},

abstract = { Why do some autocratic states allocate more resources to the military than others? We contend that as narrow political interests have more influence on a leader, relative to broader political interests, a state's military burden increases. Further, we argue that two domestic factors are central to explaining the relative strength of narrow political interests for military spending, and therefore variation in state military burden. First, institutions that increase the cost of political participation reduce the influence of the median citizen, increasing the strength of narrow political interests and, concomitantly, military spending. Second, as a regime ages, narrow interests become more entrenched and the regime becomes less concerned about overthrow. In turn, older regimes spend more on their militaries. We test hypotheses from this argument by examining the military burden for all autocracies over the period 1950--2000. We find that variation in restrictions on political participation and the age of the regime are central to understanding differences in military spending among autocracies. Further, once these institutional features are taken into account, we find only modest support for the view that certain types of regimes spend more than others. What matters is not regime type but specific institutional features that affect the strength of narrow interests and vary across, and within, autocratic regimes. },

abstract = {We estimate a model of illicit drugs markets using data on purchases of crack cocaine. Buyers are searching for high-quality drugs, but they determine drugs' quality (i.e., their purity) only after consum-ing them. Hence, sellers can rip off first-time buyers or can offer higher-quality drugs to induce buyers to purchase from them again. In equilibrium, a distribution of qualities persists. The estimated model implies that if drugs were legalized, in which case purity could be regulated and hence observable, the average purity of drugs would increase by approximately 20 percent and the dispersion would decrease by approximately 80 percent. Moreover, increasing penalties may raise the purity and affordability of the drugs traded by increasing sellers' relative profitability of targeting loyal buyers versus first-time buyers. (JEL D12, K42, L15, L65) How do markets for illicit commodities, such as narcotics, differ from regular markets? What would happen to the consumption and prices of narcotics if their trade were legalized? How do changes in the intensity of enforcement affect them? The goal of this paper is to provide quantitative answers of these questions. With this goal in mind, we estimate a model that focuses on pervasive moral hazard as the distinguishing characteristic of the retail market for illicit drugs—i.e., the " cut-ting " of drugs.},

In this paper we develop a model of foreign influence and apply it to the study of optimal tariffs. In a two-country voting model of electoral competition, we allow the incumbent party in each country to take costly actions that probabilistically affect the electoral outcome in the other country. We show that policies end up maximizing a weighted sum of domestic and foreign welfare. Using this formulation we show that foreign influence increases aggregate world welfare when there are no other means of alleviating the externalities that arise from cross-border effects of policies. In contrast, when countries can engage in international agreements, foreign influence can prove harmful as powerful countries may refuse to offer concessions. We also show that power imbalances are particularly detrimental to cooperation when they are positively correlated with economic size.},

abstract = {This research note analyzes the importance of geography for the study of conflict and explores the question: Does the geographic location (relative to the nations involved) of a confrontation influence the likelihood that the confrontation will escalate to war? It was discovered that if a dispute is contiguous by land to one of the disputants, the likelihood of escalation is increased (and increased even more if both sides are contiguous to the site). Ninety-two percent of the wars in the sample began with a dispute that was contiguous to one or both disputants; only two percent of the noncontiguous disputes escalated to war. Various interpretations of the results and suggestions for future research are noted. In the formative years of international relations as a discipline, scholars devoted a great deal of attention to geography. The theoretical approaches of Mahan (1918), Mackinder (1919), and Spykman (1944) first suggested that a nation's geographic location or control over specified areas of the globe was critical in understanding conflict. As international relations matured as a subfield, debates focused on world views, methodological approaches, and power, leaving the importance of geography to be considered by historians and military geographers. Geographic factors, however, have not been completely ignored in the study of conflict. In his classic study, Statistics of Deadly Quarrels, Lewis F. Richardson (1960) pointed out that the number of frontiers a nation had was directly related to the number of external wars in which it participated.' Starr and Most (1978) qualified Richardson's conclusions by demonstrating that a large number of colonial frontiers increased the likelihood of war, while a large number of home frontiers had the opposite effect.2 Other recent work (Most and Starr, 1980; Bremer, 1982; Starr and Most, 1983) has examined the "diffusion hypothesis," which states that conflict within a nation increases the probability that its neighbors will also become involved in conflict.

The median voter theorem is recovered if and only if voters' policy preferences are uncorrelated with the precision of their beliefs about each candidate, and preferences are distributed symmetrically. When preferences are correlated with precision or are asymmetric, even election-motivated parties diverge away from each other, as both parties gain more from appealing to the voters with more precise beliefs over their particular platform. As the population becomes polarized in how they form beliefs about politics, they will become polarized on political grounds as well, providing a new explanation for recent political polarization in the United States which, under reasonable assumptions, is more in line with the stylized facts than models with perfect observability.},

abstract = {We evaluate two alternative models of international trade in differentiated products. An increasing returns model where varieties are linked to firms predicts home market effects: increases in a country's share of demand cause disproportionate increases in its share of output. In contrast, a constant returns model with national product differentiation predicts a less than proportionate increase. We examine a panel of U.S. and Canadian manufacturing industries to test the models. Although we find support for either model, depending on whether we estimate based on within or between variation, the preponderance of the evidence supports national product differentiation. (JEL F12, F15) The increasing returns trade model introduced by Paul R. Krugman (1980) predicts that strong demand at home raises domestic production for export. A large home market for the products of a manufacturing industry translates into a disproportionate share of output and a trade surplus. This "home market effect" derives from the choice of location by mobile firms producing symmetric varieties. A reduction of trade barriers in this model causes firms to relocate to the larger market and serve the small market through exports. In contrast, when varieties are tied to the nation of production-national product differentiation-and there are constant returns to scale, the home market effect is reversed: The smaller country may be the net exporter of manufactures. Moreover, trade liberalization enables the small country's industry to increase its share of output because small-market firms gain improved access to the consumers in the larger foreign market. The contrasting predictions of what we will refer to as the increasing returns (IRS) and national product differentiation (NPD) models are reflected in different relationships between a country's share of production and its share of demand. The IRS model predicts that an increase in the demand share of one trading partner will elicit a more than one-for-one increase in that country's output share, whereas the NPD model predicts a less than one-for-one relationship. We use matched three-digit industry data for Canadian and U.S. manufacturing for the period 1990-1995 to evaluate the models. Alternatively using between (cross-sectional) and within (time-series) variation in our panel, we provide estimates of the slope of the line relating a country's share of output in an industry to its share of demand in that industry. Our sample period includes tariff reductions mandated by the 1988 Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (FTA). Information on tariffs enables us to conduct four useful exercises. First, we measure the elasticity of substitution between varieties, a key parameter in both the national product differentiation and increasing returns models. Second , we decompose the "border effect" impeding consumption of goods produced abroad into the portion attributable to tariffs and the portion resulting from all other trade barriers. Third, we assess the influence of tariffs on the slope of the output share-demand share relationship, which we show to differ depending on the model. Finally, we examine how industries with relatively large demand shares differ},

After the creation of the International Criminal Court, the United States tried to get countries, regardless of whether they were parties to the Court or not, to sign agreements not to surrender Americans to the Court. Why did some states sign and others not? Given United States power and threats of military sanctions, some states did sign. However, such factors tell only part of the story. When refusing to sign, many states emphasized the moral value of the court. Further, states with a high domestic rule of law emphasized the importance of keeping their commitment. This article therefore advances two classic arguments that typically are difficult to substantiate; namely, state preferences are indeed partly normative, and international commitments do not just screen states; they also constrain.},

abstract = {In addition to standard trade gains, regional trade agreements (RTAs) can promote peaceful relations by increasing the opportunity cost of conflicts. Country pairs with large trade gains from RTAs and a high probability of conflict should be more likely to sign an RTA. Using data from 1950 to 2000, we show that this complementarity between economic and politics determines the geography of RTAs. We disentangle trade gains from political factors by a theory-driven empirical estimation and find that country pairs with higher frequency of past wars are more likely to sign RTAs, the more so the larger the trade gains. (JEL D72, D74, F15, N70) "{\ldots} people forget too often about the political objectives of the European constitution. The argument in favor of the single currency should be based on the desire to live together in peace,"-Jacques Delors (former president of the European Commission 1997). R egional trade agreements (RTAs) have a bad reputation among a number of economists. Many scholars argue that they constitute a threat to the carefully constructed postwar multilateral trade system. Whereas multilateral trade liberalization has stalled, the number of RTAs has massively expanded during the last two decades, and they are now well over 300. The well-known problem with these bilateral and regional agreements is that, although they create trade, they also generate distortions by excluding countries. 1 Much less attention has been paid (by economists) to the political and strategic motivations for regional integration, even 1 The most recent evidence (Baier and Bergstrand 2007, using gravity equations) on trade creation finds a relatively large effect: RTAs are on average responsible for a doubling of trade between two members after ten years. Baier and Bergstrand (2009) use matching techniques and confirm this large effect of RTAs on trade between members. Much less is known about trade diversion and, therefore, the potential economic costs of these preferential agreements. Hence, the economic case for RTAs is still an open debate.},

" Based only on the value of the gravity constants, we derive sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the trade equilibrium and, given observed trade flows, completely characterize all comparative statics for any change in bilateral trade fric-tions. We then develop a methodology for estimating these gravity constants without needing to assume a particular micro-foundation of the gravity trade model.

This article links these features to shifts in the distribution of power and to the fact that one of the functions of fighting is to forestall adverse shifts. The analysis centers on a simple model of state consolidation. The equilibrium displays these features: Fighting occurs when the distribution of power is shifting rapidly. The factions avoid fighting and cut deals when the distribution of power shifts slowly or is stable. Fighting resumes if the distribution of power again begins to shift rapidly. The analysis also shows that state consolidation can occur without fighting if the process is sufficiently slow. Fighting now rather than later can also reduce the total cost of fighting.},

But the standard measure of relative mili-tary power, the capability ratio, is barely better than random guessing at predicting military dispute outcomes. We use machine learning tools to build a superior proxy, the Dispute Outcome Expectations score, from the same underlying data. Our measure is an order of magnitude better than the capability ratio at predicting dispute outcomes. In replications of 18 recent empirical studies in international relations, we find that replacing the standard measure with DOE scores usually improves both in-sample and out-of-sample goodness of fit. More broadly, we argue that scholars should focus on out-of-sample predictive power when constructing prox-ies for important concepts in political science. Our approach illustrates how machine learning tools can automate this process.},

The combination of juvenile and adult arrest data, labor market, and background variables make the sample we analyze, the 1958 Philadelphia Birth Cohort Study, especially well-suited to examining the relative importance of these aspects of individual capital. We find that human capital measures such as number of years of schooling have a significant impact on criminal choice in adulthood. We find that social capital measures such as peer influences during youth are also key predictors of criminality.},

abstract = {What explains the strategically costly and ill-planned American invasion and occupa-tion of Iraq? What accounts for Saddam Hussein's failure to take actions that might have deflected it? These decisions can be explored with rationalist tools, including the existence of credible commitment problems and asymmetries in information. 1 But explanations of this sort beg a number of important questions. The Clinton and Bush administrations did not differ substantially in their information about Iraq. But Bush administration officials—and the president himself—did hold beliefs that differed substantially from those of their predecessors, and those beliefs had profound effects. Decision making by both Iraqi and US leaders displayed strong biases. Saddam Hussein failed to recognize that the United States was committed to war unless he was willing to reveal credibly that he had, in fact, dismantled his weapons of mass destruction. The United States signaled its intentions repeatedly, but the Iraqi leader remained impervious to new information. Bush administration officials believed that the Americans would be greeted as liberators and democracy would flourish of its own accord. Such motivated reasoning both precipitated war and con-tributed to the failure to plan adequately for rebuilding the Iraqi state in war's wake. The causes of the Iraq War and the disastrous consequences of its aftermath appear to lie as much in the realm of beliefs and decision making as in standard theories of bargaining. Similar anomalies can be found in the study of international political economy. The theory of open-economy politics offers clear predictions about individual preferences with respect to trade policy.

Although we know that territorial disputes fuel conflict and that conflict dampens trade, we know less about whether the prospects of economic gains contribute to the settlement of disputes and subsequent compliance with those settlements. I argue that research in this area could profitably adopt an emerging view of borders as institutions that not only distribute territory but also allow cooperation and the production of joint gains.

The sides alternate offers from three possible offers, with war and its costs starting if the target's counteroffer is rejected. The equilibrium of the model falls into four different cases. These four cases are analyzed to determine how the sides communicate through their offers and how the costs of war, initial beliefs, misperceptions, and distribution of capabilities drive the probabilities of a crisis and war. The model demonstrates a joint selection bias-misspecification problem in empirical studies of crises arising from the unobservable nature of beliefs. Several empirical studies of crisis bargaining are discussed in the light of this methodological problem, new patterns of evidence are found that support the presence of the selection problem, and their conclusions are reexamined.},

abstract = {This paper creates a multinomial framework for ideal point estimation (mIRT) using recent developments in Bayesian statistics. The core model relies on a flexible multinomial specification that includes most common models in political science as "special cases". I show that popular extensions (e.g. dynamic smoothing, inclusion of covariates, and network models) can be easily incorporated whilst maintaining the ability to estimate a model using a Gibbs Sampler or exact EM algorithm. By showing that these models can be written and estimated using a shared framework, the paper aims to reduce the proliferation of bespoke ideal point models as well as extend the ability of applied researchers to estimate models quickly using the EM algorithm. I apply this framework to a thorny question in scaling survey responses-the treatment of non-response. Focusing on the American National Election Study (ANES), I suggest that a simple but principled solution is to treat questions as multinomial where non-response is a distinct (modeled) category. The exploratory results suggest that certain questions tend to attract many more invalid answers and that many of these questions (particularly when singling out particular social groups for evaluation) are masking non-centrist (typically conservative) beliefs.},

This includes war, terrorism, homicides, assaults and domestic violence against women and children. The cost of conventionally defined interpersonal violence, that is, homicides and assault, are about 7.5 times higher than the cost due to war and terrorism. I also estimate the costs of non-fatal domestic violence against children and women and suggest that these costs are much higher than the combined costs of homicide, assault, terrorism and war. The main reason is that the prevalence of these types of violence is very high: possibly as many as 16 per cent of all children are punished using violent methods and about 12 per cent of all women experience intimate partner violence. Richer societies have lower levels of violence, and there is evidence that prevalence rates have been declining over time. However, it is often unclear why this is the case.

This article clarifies the distinction between combatant deaths, battle deaths, and war deaths. A new dataset of battle deaths in armed conflict is presented for the period 1946-2002. Global battle deaths have been decreasing over most of this period, mainly due to a decline in interstate and internationalised civil armed conflict. It is far more difficult to accurately assess the number of war deaths in conflicts both past and present. But there are compelling reasons to believe that there is a need for increased attention to non-battle causes of mortality, especially displacement and disease in conflict studies. Therefore, it is demographers, public health specialists, and epidemiologists who can best describe the true human cost of many recent armed conflicts and assess the actions necessary to reduce that toll.},

abstract = {This paper provides new evidence on the extent of underreporting of gun violence. Criminal activity is often selectively underreported-that is, underreported in a non-random manner. This can make it difficult to understand public safety problems and devise effective policy strategies to address them. However, new surveillance technologies are facilitating the collection of more accurate data on crime. In this paper, we describe data on gunfire incidents, recorded using a tool called ShotSpotter. We compare those data with previously-available data on gun violence (reported crime and 911 calls) to estimate baseline correlations between these measures as well as the causal effect of gunfire incidents on reporting. Using data from Washington, DC, and Oakland, CA, we find that only 12{\%} of gunfire incidents result in a 911 call to report gunshots, and only 2-7{\%} of incidents result in a reported assault with a dangerous weapon. These extremely low reporting rates have important implications for research on gun violence. The characteristics and research potential of ShotSpotter data are relevant to surveillance data more broadly; while such data have not yet been exploited by social scientists, they could be extremely valuable for crime research and policy.},

abstract = {In the past few decades multistore retailers, especially those with 100 or more stores, have experienced substantial growth. At the same time, there is widely reported public outcry over the impact of these chain stores on other retailers and local communities. This paper develops an empirical model to assess the impact of chain stores on other discount retailers and to quantify the size of the scale economies within a chain. The model has two key features. First, it allows for flexible competition patterns among all players. Second, for chains, it incorporates the scale economies that arise from operating multiple stores in nearby regions. In doing so, the model relaxes the commonly used assumption that entry in different markets is independent. The lattice theory is exploited to solve this complicated entry game among chains and other discount retailers in a large number of markets. It is found that the negative impact of Kmart's presence on Wal-Mart's profit was much stronger in 1988 than in 1997, while the opposite is true for the effect of Wal-Mart's presence on Kmart's profit. Having a chain store in a market makes roughly 50{\%} of the discount stores unprofitable. Wal-Mart's expansion from the late 1980s to the late 1990s explains about 40–50{\%} of the net change in the number of small discount stores and 30–40{\%} for all other discount stores. Scale economies were important for Wal-Mart, but less so for Kmart, and the magnitude did not grow proportionately with the chains' sizes.},

We collect 5.7 billion observations of applied tariff rates that 136 countries apply to their trading partners. We then develop a Bayesian multilevel estimator that distinguishes the effects of regime type across industries and trading partners. We find that democracies tend to have lower trade barriers than non-democracies but are more likely to protect their agricultural sectors. We also find that pairs of democracies achieve greater tariff reductions in bilateral Free Trade Agreements than dyads with a democracy and a non-democracy because of shallower concessions granted by non-democratic importers to their democratic partners; democratic importers meanwhile still grant concessions to their non-democratic partners. Our findings add nuance to the claim that democratic political institutions facilitate unilateral and bilateral trade liberalization.},

There, they emerge as "stationary bandits" providing protection. A similar shock for gold, whose hard-to-find valuable output can be concealed from customs' inspections, leads armed actors to require working permits to work at gold mines, and to introduce an illicit tax on food sales in the villages where wealth from gold is in circulation. Rather than at the mines, "stationary bandits" providing protection emerge in these villages, where they also create illicit fiscal and judicial administrations to increase revenues from sales taxes, poll taxes, and tolls. Incidentally, if population well-being is part of the stationary bandit's objective, having a stationary bandit increases household welfare. The findings suggest that, irrespective of their stated goals, armed actors may create, intensify, or disinvest in the "essential functions of a state" to better expropriate. In some cases, these functions can enable economic growth.},

We argue that during negotiations governments adopted the positions of the international partners on whom they depend for a diverse set of goods that includes trade, security, and foreign policy success in international organizations. We label this set of partners a dependence network. In our approach, leaders watch closely how other governments behave within their dependence network and alter their own actions accordingly. We test this theory against a variety of other explanations on a new database that codes state negotiating positions relative to four key institutional features of the ICC. We find that trade networks substantially influence state negotiating positions on the ICC even taking into account an array of other factors. {\textcopyright} 2009 Southern Political Science Association.},

abstract = {Although in principle states can bargain over the entire extent of their combined territory, we observe historically that states bargain within far more limited confines defined by well-bounded claims. We argue that this observation stems from the fact that states generally have limited territorial aims due either to limited benefits of obtaining additional territory and/or the costs of absorbing and controlling new territories and their inhabitants. Using a formal model, we show that introducing states with limited aims over territory has strategic implications for bargaining that have not been appreciated in canonical models that do not consider heterogeneity in state preferences. Whereas traditional models generally imply that small demands undermine the credibility of a challenger's threat, the existence of states with limited territorial aims makes limited demands credible, effective, and stable in the face of shocks to relative power. We then employ geospatial data on the geographic extent of territorial disputes in the period 1947-2000 to establish two results: the size of claims is weakly related to the relative power of disputants and unaffected by dramatic changes in power, and smaller claims are associated with a higher probability that the challenger will receive any concession. Ambition should be made of sterner stuff.-William Shakespeare Julius Caesar, Act 3, Scene 2 The story of Adolf Hitler's territorial ambitions is well known. After annexing Austria in 1938, Hitler demanded the right to self-determination for ethnic Germans living in the Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia. When Britain and France conceded the annexation of regions composed of more than 50{\%} Germans-on the basis of plebiscites that would presumably favor Germany-Hitler upped his demands, asking for additional counties where Germans were not in the majority, denied the use of plebiscites, and required that Polish and Hungarian territorial demands be accommodated as well. The September 1938 Munich Agreement met Hitler's demands in exchange for a promise that he would pursue no further territorial claims on Czechoslovakia. Hitler broke this promise 6 months later when he invaded and annexed what was left of the country, a feat that was made},

abstract = {and Keywords Essentially all scholars agree that the levels of violent conflict, especially wars, within democratic pairs of states are significantly lower than levels of violent conflict within other pairs of states. However, debate rages as to whether this observed correlation is causal or spurious. Does democracy actually cause peace? Answering this question is critical for both scholarly and policy debates. Critics have lodged two sets of arguments proposing that the observed correlation between democracy and peace does not mean that democracy causes peace. First, some claim that the peace observed among democracies is not caused by regime type, but rather by other factors such as national interest, economic factors, and gender norms. These critics often present statistical analyses in which inclusion of these or other factors render the democracy independent variable to be statistically insignificant, leading them to draw the conclusion that democracy does not cause peace. The second critique claims that there is a causal relationship between democracy and peace, but peace causes democracy and not the reverse. Peaceful international environments permit democracy to emerge, and conflictual international environments impede democracy. Though peace causes democracy, democracy does not cause peace. Careful examination of the theoretical claims of these critiques and especially the pertinent empirical scholarship produces two general conclusions. First, there is enough evidence to conclude that democracy does cause peace at least between democracies, that the observed correlation between democracy and peace is not spurious. Second, this conclusion notwithstanding, the critiques do make important contributions, in the sense that they demonstrate that several factors (including democracy) cause peace, that there may be some qualifications or limitations to the scope of the democratic peace, and that causality among factors like democracy and peace is likely bidirectional, part of a larger dynamic system.},

The objective is to derive formulae that could in principle be implemented in particular pricing problems, and to determine the informational requirements of a quantity-dependent pricing policy. For the most part, the problem that is dealt with is that of maximizing the total net surplus, subject to a profitability constraint. This problem bears a close family resemblance to a number of related problems that can be understood with minor modifications of the models. For example, profit maximization is a special case of the profit-constrained net surplus problem. There is a rich menu of relatively recent papers dealing with the single product problem. Economist J. Mirrlees provided the analytical breakthrough in the optimal income taxation problem, that made much of the subsequent work possible. Economist M. Weitzman dealt with the question of whether and when rationing was preferable to prices in distributing commodity in short supply.},

Several scholars have offered rules for delineating such "relevant dy-ads". One common element of such rules is contiguity. A second common element is major power status. Any dyad involving either contiguous states or a major power is defined as relevant. Such definitions of relevant dy-ads are simple and useful. Nevertheless, I contend that some contiguous dyads are not relevant to study of the causes of war, while some non-contiguous dyads are relevant. For example, Israel and Iraq are neither contigu-ous, nor major powers. With existing definitions this dyad is not deemed relevant. I offer an operational defini-tion of relevant dyads that delineates which dyads are proximate enough in terms of distance and terrain to be potential war fighters, regardless of major or minor power status. Adapting existing work on the loss-of-strength gradient, I argue that each member of the international system has an area of the globe within which it can act militarily. This area is the relevant neighborhood of that country. Relevant-dyads are found where relevant neighborhoods overlap.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the role of the transportation sector in world trade. We build a spatial model that centers on the interaction of the market for (oceanic) transportation services and the market for world trade in goods. The model delivers equilibrium trade flows, as well as equilibrium trade costs (shipping prices). Using detailed data on vessel movements and shipping prices, we document novel facts about shipping patterns; we then flexibly estimate our model. We use this setup to demonstrate that the transportation sector (i) attenuates differences in the comparative advantage across countries; (ii) generates network effects in trade costs; and (iii) dampens the impact of shocks on trade flows. These three mechanisms reveal a new role for geography in international trade that was previously concealed by the frequently‐used assumption of exogenous trade costs. Finally, we illustrate how our setup can be used for policy analysis by evaluating the impact of future and existing infrastructure projects (e.g., Northwest Passage, Panama Canal).},

However, existing tests of this claim examine only one possible form of trade protection: tariffs. This leaves open the possibility that governments in majoritarian systems provide no more protection than governments in proportional systems but simply use tariffs more often than other forms of trade protection. Does the protectionist bias in majoritarian politics extend beyond tariffs? The current study addresses this question by examining an increasingly important form of trade protection: subsidies. In a sample of 68 countries from 1990 to 2006, spending on subsidies is found to be higher in majoritarian systems than in proportional systems, holding all else equal. The implication is that the protectionist bias in majoritarian systems does in fact extend beyond tariffs.},

Using forty years of agricultural micro-data from India, we show that falling trade costs increased farmer's revenue volatility, causing farmers to shift production toward crops with less risky yields. We then characterize how volatility affects farmer's crop allocation using a portfolio choice framework where returns are determined in general equilibrium by a many- location, many-good Ricardian trade model with flexible trade costs. Finally, we structurally estimate the model—recovering farmers' unobserved risk-return preferences from the gradient of the mean-variance frontier at their observed crop choice—to quantify the second moment effects of trade. While the expansion of the Indian highway network would have increased the volatility of farmer's real income had their crop choice remained constant, by changing what they produced farmers were able to avoid this increased volatility and amplify the gains from trade.},
