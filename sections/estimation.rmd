The model's equilibrium depends on a vector of parameters $\bm{\theta}_m = \left( \bm{b}, \bm{\alpha}, \gamma, \hat{c}, \sigma_{\epsilon}^2 \right)$, as well as the values of the shocks $\left\{ \xi_{ij} \right\}_{i,j \in \left\{ 1, \dots, N \right\}}$ and $\left\{ \epsilon_{ij} \right\}_{i,j \in \left\{ 1, \dots, N \right\}}$. Because I work with an equilibrium in changes, a prediction $\hat{\tilde{\tau}}_{ij}^\star = 1$ is consistent with the data -- the model predicts that in equilibrium, government $i$ would make no changes to its factual trade policy toward $j$.

Estimation leverages Assumptions `r Axi` and `r Aepsilon`. First, note that these assumptions imply
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\E_{\xi, \epsilon} \left[ \hat{\tilde{\bm{\tau}}}_i^\star(\bm{1}; \bm{\theta}_m) \right] = \argmax_{ \hat{\tilde{\bm{\tau}}}_i } & \quad \hat{G}_i(\hat{\tilde{\bm{\tau}}}_i; \bm{1}) \\
\text{subject to} & \quad \hat{G}_j(\hat{\tilde{\bm{\tau}}}) - \hat{G}_j(\hat{\bm{\tau}}_i^{j \star}) + \hat{c} \E_{\epsilon} \left[ \tilde{\chi}_{ji}(\bm{Z}; \bm{\theta}_m)^{-1} \right] \geq 0 \quad \text{for all } j \neq i
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
where the affinity shocks drop out of the maximand. For any guess of the parameter vector $\bm{\theta}_m$, I can calculate the expected best response to observed policies $\E \left[ \hat{\tilde{\bm{\tau}}}_i^\star(\bm{1}; \bm{\theta}_m) \right]$ for each $i$. In practice, I compute this quantity by recasting \ref{eq:tauTildeStarHat} as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints [@Su2012], which I discuss further in Appendix `r Ampec`. From here, I can construct a loss function
$$
\ell_{\bm{\tau}}(\bm{\theta}_m) = \sum_i \sum_j \left| \tau_{ij} \left( \E \left[ \hat{\tilde{\tau}}_{ij}^\star(\bm{1}; \bm{\theta}_m) \right] - 1 \right) \right|
$$
where $\tau_{ij}$ is the observed policy and $\tau_{ij} \E \left[ \hat{\tilde{\tau}}_{ij}^\star(\bm{1}; \bm{\theta}_m) \right]$ is the predicted best response.

The war constraints are informative about the value of the parameters $\bm{\alpha}$ and $\gamma$. Consider the case in which the $i$'s war constraint vis-à-vis $j$ holds with certainty. Then,
$$
\hat{\tilde{G}}_j(\hat{\tilde{\bm{\tau}}}^\star; b_j) - \left( \hat{G}_j(\hat{\bm{\tau}}_i^{j\star}; b_j) - \hat{c} \tilde{\chi}_{ji}(\bm{Z}; \bm{\theta}_m)^{-1} \right) = 0
$$
which can be rearranged as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:constraintRegression}
\ln \left( \frac{ 1 }{ \hat{c}^{-1} \left( \hat{G}_j(\hat{\tau}_i^{j\star}) - \hat{\tilde{G}}_j(\hat{\tilde{\bm{\tau}}}^\star; b_j) \right) - 1 } \right) = \gamma \ln \left( \frac{ M_j }{ M_i } \right) - \bm{\alpha}^T W_{ji} + \epsilon_{ji}
\end{equation}
. The left side is a measure of the difference between $j$'s equilibrium utility difference and it's conquest value ($\hat{G}_j(\hat{\tau}_i^{j\star}) - \hat{\tilde{G}}_j(\hat{\tilde{\bm{\tau}}}^\star; b_j)$) -- the benefits from conquest. The extent to which these correlates with $j$'s military advantage over $i$ ($M_j / M_i$) is informative about the returns to military power, $\gamma$. The extent to which this correlates with dyadic geography is informative about the power projection parameters $\bm{\alpha}$.

In Appendix `r Aalphagamma` I show that if the conquest value is sufficiently high, there exists an $\epsilon_{ji}^\star(\bm{Z}; \bm{\theta}_m)$ such that for all $\epsilon_{ji} \geq \epsilon_{ji}^\star(\bm{Z}; \bm{\theta}_m)$, $i$'s constraint vis-à-vis $j$ holds. I can then construct a stochastic variant of \ref{eq:constraintRegression} which can be used as a second moment condition. This condition generates a second loss function, $\ell_{\epsilon}(\bm{\theta}_m)$ (Equation \ref{eq:lossEpsilon}).

I estimate the model by minimizing the sum of these two loss functions. Formally, I seek estimates $\hat{\bm{\theta}}_m$ such that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:thetaLoss}
\tilde{\bm{\theta}}_m \in \argmin_{\bm{\theta}_m} \quad \ell_{\bm{\tau}}(\bm{\theta}_m) + \ell_{\epsilon}(\bm{\theta}_m)
\end{equation}

In practice, I minimize these loss functions using an iterative procedure. In the first stage, I hold $\gamma$ and $\bm{\alpha}$ fixed and miminize $\ell_{\bm{\tau}}(\bm{\theta}_m)$ via adaptive grid search over $\bm{b}$. Then, I hold these values fixed and choose $\gamma$ and $\bm{\alpha}$ to minimize $\ell_{\epsilon}(\bm{\theta}_m)$ using an ordinary least squares variant. I then return to the first stage and iterate until the loss functions stabilize. I discuss this procedure in more detail in Appendix `r AestimationAlg`. 

Because they affect coercion potential similarly, $\bm{\alpha}$ and $\hat{c}$ are difficult to separately identify. I therefore set $\hat{c} =$ `r c_hat_tilde` and report estimates for other parameters consistent with this value.

Fixing governments' preferences and the relative costs of war, the probability that constraints are binding on governments' trade policy choices can be calculated. The responsiveness of the constraints that bind with high probability to the military capability ratio ($M_j / M_i$) and dyadic geography $\bm{W}_{ji}$ are informative about $\gamma$ and $\bm{\alpha}$ respectively. 

This procedure produces point estimates $\tilde{\bm{\theta}}_m$. I then construct uncertainty intervals through nonparametric bootstrap, sampling policies and constraints and re-estimating $\tilde{\bm{\theta}}_m$.
